CS , Data structures  , In-memory XPath processing; NESTOR; Set-based data models; Data structures        ,"XML is a pervasive technology for representing and accessing semi-structured data. XPath is the standard language for navigational queries on XML documents and there is a growing demand for its efficient processing. In order to increase the efficiency in executing four navigational XML query primitives, namely descendants, ancestors, children and parent, we introduce a new paradigm where traditional approaches based on the efficient traversing of nodes and edges to reconstruct the requested subtrees are replaced by a brand new one based on basic set operations which allow us to directly return the desired subtree, avoiding to create it passing through nodes and edges. Our solution stems from the NEsted SeTs for Object hieRarchies (NEASTOR) formal model, which makes use of set-inclusion relations for representing and providing access to hierarchical data. We define in-memory efficient data structures to implement NESTOR, we develop algorithms to perform the descendants, ancestors, children and parent query primitives and we study their computational complexity. We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation by using several datasets: digital archives (EAD collections), INEX 2009 Wikipedia collection, and two widely-used synthetic datasets (XMark and XGen). We show that NESTOR-based data structures and query primitives consistently outperform state-of-the-art solutions for XPath processing at execution time and they are competitive in terms of both memory occupation and pre-processing time.

Civil , Ambient Intelligence  , Home energy management; persuasive interface; smart metering; behavior modeling; ambient intelligence        ,"The integration of renewable energy sources increases the complexity in maintaining the power grid. In particular, the highly dynamic nature of generation and consumption demands for a better utilization of energy resources, which seen the cost of storage infrastructure, can only be achieved through demand-response. Accordingly, the availability of energy and potential overload situations can be reflected using a price signal. The effectiveness of this mechanism arises from the flexibility of device operation, which is nevertheless heavily reliant on the exchange of information between the grid and its consumers. In this paper, we investigate the capability of an interactive energy management system to timely inform users on energy usage, in order to promote an optimal use of local resources. In particular, we analyze data being collected in several households in Italy and Austria to gain insights into usage behavior and drive the design of more effective systems. The outcome is the formulation of energy efficiency policies for residential buildings, as well as the design of an energy management system, consisting of hardware measurement units and a management software. The Mjolnir framework, which we release for open use, provides a platform where various feedback concepts can be implemented and assessed. This includes widgets displaying disaggregated and aggregated consumption information, as well as daily production and tailored advices. The formulated policies were implemented as an advisor widget able to autonomously analyze usage and provide tailored energy feedback. The advisor is estimated leading to a potential of 34% of savings using measurement data from the GREEND dataset."

In this way the competitive hybrid electric vehicle can be created."
Medical , Hepatitis C  , complications; patient engagement; patient-centered care; research priority setting; transplantation        ,"Barriers to access and long-term complications remain a challenge in transplantation. Further advancements may be achieved through research priority setting with patient engagement to strengthen its relevance. We evaluated research priority setting in solid organ transplantation and described stakeholder priorities. Databases were searched to October 2016. We synthesized the findings descriptively. The 28 studies (n = 2071 participants) addressed kidney [9 (32%)], heart [7 (25%)], liver [3 (11%)], lung [1 (4%)], pancreas [1 (4%)], and nonspecified organ transplantation [7 (25%)] using consensus conferences, expert panel meetings, workshops, surveys, focus groups, interviews, and the Delphi technique. Nine (32%) reported patient involvement. The 336 research priorities addressed the following: organ donation [43 priorities (14 studies)]; waitlisting and allocation [43 (10 studies)]; histocompatibility and immunology [31 (8 studies)]; immunosuppression [21 (10 studies)]; graft-related complications [38 (13 studies)]; recipient (non-graft-related) complications [86 (14 studies)]; reproduction [14 (1 study)], psychosocial and lifestyle [49 (7 studies)]; and disparities in access and outcomes [10 (4 studies)]. The priorities identified were broad but only one-third of initiatives engaged patients/caregivers, and details of the process were lacking. Setting research priorities in an explicit manner with patient involvement can guide investment toward the shared priorities of patients and health professionals."
ECE , Control engineering  , force feedback haptic interface; virtual reality; control algorithm; EtherCAT fieldbus; 3D visualization; Matlab/Simulink        ,This paper is to present a technological solution for implementing a force feedback haptic interface in the context of virtual reality interaction applications. The real-time haptic algorithms are implemented in TwinCAT runtime environment to control drivers via EtherCAT fieldbus. A 3-dimensional visualization model for the virtual reality interaction is developed through Virtual Reality Toolbox in Matlab/Simulink and interconnected with TwinCAT software through the Automation Device Specification communication protocol. The using of Matlab/Simulink with model-based programming method instead of the C++ programming language allows researchers in haptic domain to focus more on the control engineering issues than programming skills. Some experimental tests and verification of the haptic algorithms with visualization model are presented.
CS , Bioinformatics  , Bioinformatics; genomics        ,"Transposable elements (TEs) constitute the most dynamic and the largest component of large plant genomes: for example, 80% to 90% of the maize genome and the wheat genome may be TEs. De novo TE annotation is therefore a computational challenge, and we investigated, using current tools in the REPET package, new strategies to overcome the difficulties. We tested our methodological developments on the sequence of the chromosome 3B of the hexaploid wheat; this chromosome is similar to 1 Gb, one of the ""fattest"" genomes ever sequenced. We successfully established various strategies for annotating TEs in such a complex dataset. Our analyses show that all of our strategies can overcome the current limitations for de novo TE discovery in large plant genomes. Relative to annotation based on a library of known TEs, our de novo approaches improved genome coverage (from 84% to 90%), and the number of full length annotated copies from 14 830 to 15905. We also developed two new metrics for qualifying TE annotation: NTE50 involves measuring the number, and LTE50 the smallest sizes of annotations that cover 50% of the genome. NTE50 decreased the number of annotations from 124868 to 93633 and LTE50 increased it from 1839 to 2659. This work shows how to obtain comprehensive and high-quality automatic TE annotation for a number of economically and agronomically important species."
Medical , Weight Loss  , Obesity; weight loss; moral work; body projects; bariatric        ,"Cultural notions equating greater morality and virtue with hard work and productive output are deeply embedded in American value systems. This is exemplified in how people understand and execute personal body projects, including efforts to become slim. Bariatric surgery is commonly viewed as a low-effort' means of losing weight, and individuals who opt for this surgery are often perceived to be cheating.' This extended ethnographic study within one bariatric program in the Southwestern United States shows how patients conscientiously perform this productivity. By prioritizing discourses that focus on their own hard work and the inherent value and necessity of their surgery, patients and practitioners alike contest the dominant public views of surgically-induced weight loss."
Psychology  , Leadership  , Data-based decision making; school improvement; accountability; school organization        ,"Although data-based decision making can lead to improved student achievement, data are often not used effectively in schools. This paper therefore focuses on conditions for effective data use. We studied the extent to which school organizational characteristics, data characteristics, user characteristics, and collaboration influenced data use for (1) accountability, (2) school development, and (3) instruction. The results of our hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analysis from this large-scale quantitative study (N = 1073) show that, on average, teachers appear to score relatively high on data use for accountability and school development. Regarding instruction, however, several data sources are used only on a yearly basis. Among the factors investigated, school organizational characteristics and collaboration have the greatest influence on teachers' data use in schools."
Psychology  , Seasonal affective disorder  , Ramelteon; sleep; agomelatine; depression; insomnia; melatonin        ,"Insomnia is common among elderly people and nearly 30 to 40% of the adult population also suffer from insomnia. Pharmacological treatment of insomnia include the use of benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine drugs like zolpidem, zaleplon, Zopiclone. Although these drugs improve sleep, their usage is also associated with number of adverse effects, Melatonin, the hormone secreted by the pineal gland of all animals and human beings has been used for treatment of insomnias, since the timing of its secretion in humans as well as in most of the animals coincides with the increase of nocturnal sleep propensity. Because of its short half life, melatonin slow release preparations were introduced for treatment of insomnia. Recently ramelteon, a selective MT1, MT2 receptor agonist with greater efficacy of action in treating insomnia has been used clinically and has been found effective in improving sleep quality, sleep efficacy and also in reducing the sleep onset time when compared to melatonin or slow melatonin preparations. The mechanism of action of ramelteon in improving sleep is discussed in the paper. Another melatonergic drug agomelatine besides acting on MT1/MT2 receptors also displays 5-HT2c antagonism and this drug has been found effective as a novel antidepressant for treating major depressive disorders. Agomelatine besides causing remission of depressive symptoms also improves sleep quality and efficiency. Other antidepressants depressants that are in clinical use today do not improve sleep. There are other melatonergic drugs like tasimelteon,6-chloromelatonin. But ramelteon and agomelatine deserve special attention for treatment of insomnia and sleep disturbances associated with depressive disorders and have promising role for treatment of sleep disorders."
CS , Data structures  , Succinct dynamic data structures; Succinct trees; Cardinal tree representations        ,"Cardinal trees (or tries of degree ) are a fundamental data structure, in particular for many text-processing algorithms. Each node in a cardinal tree has at most children, each labeled with a symbol from the alphabet . In this paper we introduce succinct representations for dynamic cardinal trees on nodes, requiring bits of space. These are the first dynamic cardinal tree representations that support a (fairly) complete set of operations while using almost optimal space. For , we show how the navigational and query operations on the tree can be supported in time, while supporting insertions and deletions of leaves in amortized time. For [and ], we show that the same set of operations can be supported in time (amortized in the case of insertions/deletions). We also show how to associate -bit satellite data to the tree nodes using extra bits. Finally, we show how the machinery introduced for dynamic cardinal trees can be adapted to represent dynamic binary trees using bits of space, so that the tree operations are supported in time (amortized in the case of insert/delete operations). We support adding satellite data to the tree nodes using extra bits [(vs. extra bits of the fastest previous dynamic representation from the literature], while providing several trade-offs for accessing/modifying the data."
Medical , Atrial Fibrillation  , Transesophageal echocardiogram; Speckletracking; Strain strain rate; Atrial fibrillation; Left atrial appendage; Stroke; CHA(2)DS(2)VASc score        ,"Vascular mechanics assessed with two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (2D-STE) could be used as a new imaging surrogate of vascular stiffening. The CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score is considered accurate as an estimate of stroke risk in non-valvular AF, although many potential stroke risk factors have not been included in this scoring method. The purpose of this research is to study the feasibility of evaluating vascular mechanics at the descending aorta in non-valvular AF patients using transesophageal 2D-STE and to analyze the association between descending aortic mechanics and stroke. We prospectively recruited a group of 44 patients referred for a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) in the context of cardioversion for non-valvular AF. A short-axis view of the descending aorta, one to two centimeters after the aortic arch was selected for the vascular mechanics assessment with the 2D-STE methodology. The vascular mechanics parameters analyzed were circumferential aortic strain (CAS) and early circumferential aortic strain rate (CASR). A clinical assessment was performed with focus on the past stroke history and the CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score. The mean age of our cohort was 65 +/- 13 years and 75% were men; AF was known for 2.8 +/- 2.5 years and it was considered paroxystic in 41% of cases. Waveforms adequate for measuring 2D-STE were present in 85% of the 264 descending aortic wall segments. The mean CAS was 3.5 +/- 1.2% and the mean CASR was 0.7 +/- 0.3 s(-1). The inter- and intra-observer variability for aortic mechanics was considered adequate. The median CHA(2)DS(2)VASc score was 2 (2-3). As the score increased we noted that both the CAS (r = -0.38, P = 0.01) and the CASR (r = -0.42, P < 0.01) decreased. Over 16% of the AF patients had a past history of stroke. These patients had lower values of both descending aortic strain [2.2 (1.8-2.6) vs. 3.9 (3.3-4.9)%, P < 0.01] and strain rate [0.4 (0.3-0.4) vs. 0.7 (0.6-1.1) s(-1), P < 0.01]. CAS remained independently associated with a past history of stroke after adjustment for the CHA(2)DS(2)VASc score. Our data showed that non-valvular AF patients with a past history of stroke had lower values of aortic mechanics assessed with transesophageal 2D-STE."
CS , Distributed computing  , Topology recognition; Leader election; Colored network; Local model        ,"Topology recognition and leader election are fundamental tasks in distributed computing in networks. The first of them requires each node to find a labeled isomorphic copy of the network, while the result of the second one consists in a single node adopting the label 1 (leader), with all other nodes adopting the label 0 and learning a path to the leader. We consider both these problems in networks whose nodes are equipped with not necessarily distinct labels called colors, and ports at each node of degree d are arbitrarily numbered 0,1,..., d - 1. Colored networks are generalizations both of labeled networks, in which nodes have distinct labels, and of anonymous networks, in which nodes do not have labels (all nodes have the same color). In colored networks, topology recognition and leader election are not always feasible. Hence we study two more general problems. Consider a colored network and an input I given to its nodes. The aim of the problem TOP, for this colored network and for I, is to solve topology recognition in this network, if this is possible under input I, and to have all nodes answer ""unsolvable"" otherwise. Likewise, the aim of the problem LE is to solve leader election in this network, if this is possible under input I, and to have all nodes answer ""unsolvable"" otherwise. We show that nodes of a network can solve problems TOP and LE, if they are given, as input I, an upper bound k on the number of nodes of a given color, called the size of this color. On the other hand we show that, if the nodes are given an input that does not bound the size of any color, then the answer to TOP and LE must be ""unsolvable"", even for the class of rings. Under the assumption that nodes are given an upper bound k on the size of a given color, we study the time of solving problems TOP and LE in the LOCAL model in which, during each round, each node can exchange arbitrary messages with all its neighbors and perform arbitrary local computations. We give an algorithm to solve each of these problems in arbitrary networks in time O(kD + D log(n/D)), where D is the diameter of the network and n is its size. We also show that this time is optimal, by exhibiting classes of networks in which every algorithm solving problems TOP or LE must use time Omega(kD + D log(n/D)). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

MAE , Hydraulics  , RETRAN-3D; Heat transfer; Condensation; Thermal-hydraulics        ,"The Great East Japan Earthquake occurred on March 11, 2011 fatally damaged the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (NPP), caused prolonged station blackout (SBO). Following the SBO, the reactor water level gradually dropped due to the increase in steam discharge from safety relief valves and eventually led to nuclear fuel melt down. Almost four years have passed since the accident, and official reports by the Japanese regulatory have given the general description of causes and progressions of the fatal accident. Even after the Fukushima accident, more than 430 nuclear power plants are currently operating and over 80 units are under construction worldwide. From this fact alone, it is extremely important to learn from the Fukushima accident and enhance the safety culture of the reactor operation to completely eliminate the possibilities of catastrophic accidents seen in 2011. In this study, the best estimate transient thermal-hydraulics code, RETRAN-03/MODO4 was utilized to focus on the effectiveness of the Isolation Condenser (IC) installed on Advanced Boiling Water Reactors (ABWR). The ICs turned out to be one of the very few operable safety systems during the Fukushima accident, and this simple yet reliable safety system should be utilized to secure ABWR from possible reactor core damages. In the present paper, several case studies conducted utilizing the ICs are presented and methods of countermeasures to improve light water reactor safety level in design and operation features are proposed.

ECE , Electric motor  , Contra-rotating fan; gearless; computational fluid dynamics; simulation; validation        ,"A gearless one-motor concept for contra-rotating fans is presented in this article. The rotors are mounted to an electric motor using only one shaft. The coupling between both rotors is realised by utilising the conservation of angular momentum. The contra-rotating fans has a diameter of 200mm at a design speed of 2100min(-1) for the first stage and 1200min(-1) for the second stage. It has been designed and investigated through a series of experiments by the Institute of Air Handling and Refrigeration in Dresden. The performance map and 2D particle image velocimetry measurements have been conducted. Numerical models for 3D quasi-steady state and transient simulations have been implemented and carried out by the Institute of Mechanics and Fluid Dynamics. The results show a good agreement between the quasi-steady, the transient simulations and the experiment. However, when close to stall, the time-resolved simulations show a superior performance compared with steady-state computations."
Psychology  , Prosocial behavior  , inequity aversion; generosity; partiality; fairness; social cognitive development; open data; open materials        ,"Children and adults respond negatively to inequity. Traditional accounts of inequity aversion suggest that as children mature into adults, they become less likely to endorse all forms of inequity. We challenge the idea that children have a unified concern with inequity that simply becomes stronger with age. Instead, we argue that the developmental trajectory of inequity aversion depends on whether the inequity is seen as fair or unfair. In three studies (N = 501), 7- to 8-year-olds were more likely than 4- to 6-year-olds to create inequity that disadvantaged themselvesa fair type of inequity. In findings consistent with our theory, 7- to 8-year-olds were not more likely than 4- to 6-year-olds to endorse advantageous inequity (Study 1) or inequity created by third parties (Studies 2 and 3)unfair types of inequity. We discuss how these results expand on recent accounts of children's developing concerns with generosity and partiality."
Medical , Alzheimer's Disease  , Mild cognitive impairment; Alzheimer's disease; Magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Brain volumetry        ,"Objective: To assess the accuracy of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) and brain volumetry in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to predict conversion to probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: Forty-eight patients fulfilling the criteria of amnestic MCI who underwent a conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) followed by MRS, and T1-3D on 1.5 Tesla MR unit. At baseline the patients underwent neuropsychological examination. 1H-MRS of the brain was carried out by exploring the left medial occipital lobe and ventral posterior cingulated cortex (vPCC) using the LCModel software. A high resolution T1-3D sequence was acquired to carry out the volumetric measurement. A cortical and subcortical parcellation strategy was used to obtain the volumes of each area within the brain. The patients were followed up to detect conversion to probable AD. Results: After a 3-year follow-up, 15 (31.2%) patients converted to AD. The myo-inositol in the occipital cortex and glutamate + glutamine (Glx) in the posterior cingulate cortex predicted conversion to probable AD at 46.1% sensitivity and 90.6% specificity. The positive predictive value was 66.7%, and the negative predictive value was 80.6%, with an overall cross-validated classification accuracy of 77.8%. The volume of the third ventricle, the total white matter and entorhinal cortex predict conversion to probable AD at 46.7% sensitivity and 90.9% specificity. The positive predictive value was 70%, and the negative predictive value was 78.9%, with an overall cross validated classification accuracy of 77.1%. Combining volumetric measures in addition to the MRS measures the prediction to probable AD has a 38.5% sensitivity and 87.5% specificity, with a positive predictive value of 55.6%, a negative predictive value of 77.8% and an overall accuracy of 733%. Conclusion: Either MRS or brain volumetric measures are markers separately of cognitive decline and may serve as a noninvasive tool to monitor cognitive changes and progression to dementia in patients with amnestic MCI, but the results do not support the routine use in the clinical settings.

Civil , Geotextile  , Shear strength; Geosynthetic; Deposition plane; Direct shear test; Interface modeling; Soil reinforcement        ,"The influence of the sand placement method above geotextile layer on interface shear strength behavior was investigated. Seven different types of woven and nonwoven geotextiles were used with only poorly graded sand. The investigation involved placement of sand layer through inclined horizontal plane with different angles. This step constitutes a fundamental step for assessing soil to be deposited in different plane and, therefore, with different internal soil fabric. The interface shear strength was evaluated using direct shear test. Although the investigated soil is uniform poorly graded sand, the influence of the deposit plane was significant especially for non-woven geotextile. Differences in soil interface shear strength associated with the tested geotextile samples show that samples with higher mass per unit area and same opening sizes had the higher interface friction angle regardless the bedding plane."
biochemistry , Northern blotting  , Bpifb1; parotid acinar cells; NOD mouse        ,"OBJECTIVE: To define the increased mRNA expression of Bpifb1, a member of the bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein family, in parotid acinar cells from non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, an animal model for Sjogren's syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Parotid acinar cells were prepared from female NOD (NOD/ShiJcl) mice with or without diabetes, as well as from control (C57BL/6JJcl) mice. Total RNA and homogenate were prepared from the parotid acinar cells. Embryonic cDNA from a Mouse MTC (TM) Panel I kit was used. The expression of Bpifb1 was determined by cDNA microarray analysis, RT-PCR, real-time PCR, northern blotting and in situ hybridization. RESULTS: The expression of Bpifb1 mRNA was high in parotid acinar cells from diabetic and non-diabetic NOD mice at 5-50 weeks of age. Acinar cells in the C57BL/6 mice had a low expression of Bpifb1 mRNA at an age >8 weeks, but had a relatively high expression in the foetus and infantile stages. CONCLUSIONS: Bpifb1 mRNA is upregulated in parotid acinar cells in NOD mice, but its expression is not related to the onset of diabetes. These findings suggest that high expression levels of Bpifb1 might predict disease traits before the onset of autoimmunity."

However, due to some limitations related to the instrument interferometric concept and its challenging data processing, SMOS SSS maps still display significant artifacts and biases, especially close to the coast, mainly due to the presence of Radio Frequency Interferences (RFI) and Land-sea contamination (LSC). In this paper, a new methodology for filtering salinity retrievals and correcting for spatial biases is introduced and validated. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
Civil , Smart Material  , shape-memory alloy; titanium-nickel alloy; superelasticity; nitrogen ion implantation; fatigue; bending        ,"A SHAPE-MEMORY ALLOY (SMA) is expected to be applied as intelligent or smart material since it shows the functional characteristics of the shape memory effect and superelasticity. Most SMA elements, with these characteristics, perform cyclic motions. In these cases, the fatigue property of SMA is one of the most important issues in view of evaluating functional characteristics of SMA elements. The fatigue proper ties are complex since they depend on stress, strain, temperature and their hysteresis. If an SMA is implanted with high-energy ions, the thermomechanical properties of the material may change, resulting in long fatigue life. In the present study, the nitrogen ion implantation was applied to modify the surface of a TiNi SMA tape and the influence of implantation treatment on the bending fatigue properties was investigated."

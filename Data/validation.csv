CS , Symbolic computation  , (2+1)-dimensional non-linear optical waves; erbium-doped optical fibre; symbolic computation; soliton solution; soliton interaction        ,"(2 + 1)-dimensional non-linear optical waves through the coherently excited resonant medium doped with the erbium atoms can be described by a (2 + 1)-dimensional non-linear Schrodinger equation coupled with the self-induced transparency equations. For such a system, via the Hirota method and symbolic computation, linear forms, one-, two-and N-soliton solutions are obtained. Asymptotic analysis is conducted and suggests that the interaction between the two solitons is elastic. Bright solitons are obtained for the fields E and P, while the dark ones for the field N, with E as the electric field, P as the polarization in the resonant medium induced by the electric field, and N as the population inversion profile of the dopant atoms. Head-on interaction between the bidirectional two solitons and overtaking interaction between the unidirectional two solitons are seen. Influence of the averaged natural frequency. on the solitons are studied: (1). can affect the velocities of all the solitons; (2) Amplitudes of the solitons for the fields P and N increase with. decreasing, and decrease with. increasing; (3) With. decreasing, for the fields P and N, one-peak one soliton turns into the two-peak one, as well as interaction type changes from the interaction between two one-peak ones to that between a one-peak one and a two-peak one; (4) For the field E, influence of. on the solitons cannot be found. The results of this paper might be of potential applications in the design of optical communication systems which can produce the bright and dark solitons simultaneously."
Medical , Alzheimer's Disease  , Aging; Tau; Amyloid; PET; Alzheimer's disease; Polypathology        ,"(beta-amyloid (A beta) and tau pathology become increasingly prevalent with age, however, the spatial relationship between the two pathologies remains unknown. We examined local (same region) and non-local (different region) associations between these 2 aggregated proteins in 46 normal older adults using [F-18]AV-1451 (for tau) and [C-11]PiB (for A beta) positron emission tomography (PET) and 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. While local voxelwise analyses showed associations between PiB and AV-1451 tracer largely in the temporal lobes, k-means clustering revealed that some of these associations were driven by regions with low tracer retention. We followed this up with a whole-brain region-by-region (local and non-local) partial correlational analysis. We calculated each participant's mean AV-1451 and PiB uptake values within 87 regions of interest (ROI). Pairwise ROI analysis demonstrated many positive PiB AV-1451 associations. Importantly, strong positive partial correlations (controlling for age, sex, and global gray matter fraction, p <.01) were identified between PiB in multiple regions of association cortex and AV-1451 in temporal cortical ROIs. There were also less frequent and weaker positive associations of regional PiB with frontoparietal AV-1451 uptake. Particularly in temporal lobe ROIs, AV-1451 uptake was strongly predicted by NB across multiple ROI locations. These data indicate that A beta and tau pathology show significant local and non-local regional associations among cognitively normal elderly, with increased PiB uptake throughout the cortex correlating with increased temporal lobe AV-1451 uptake. The spatial relationship between A beta and tau accumulation does not appear to be specific to A beta location, suggesting a regional vulnerability of temporal brain regions to tau accumulation regardless of where AP accumulates."
Civil , Green Building  , LED lighting system; PV system; Distributed lighting control; Energy efficiency; Green building; Daylight responsive dimming system        ,"(D)ecreasing of energy consumption and environmentally friendly energy resources are the issues in the foreground nowadays. As the electric energy consumed for the illumination is high, long-lasting and low-consumption LED (light-emitting diode) technology gets prominent. There have been made much reseacrh regarding the use of photovoltaic sytems in meeting the energy demand in housing and industry. However, there is need for more research with regards to photovoltaic sytems' integration with energy efficiency sytems. In this study, for the environments which have different lighting levels due to daylight factor, there has been proposed a low-cost PV (photovoltaics) based and distributed sensor smart LED illuminating system and there has been acquired 72.075% more energy saving in comparison with conventional LED illuminating system.

ECE , Electric motor  , NdFeB magnets; Electric motor; Electric vehicle; Hybrid electric vehicle; Recycling; Rare earth elements        ,"(Hybrid) electric vehicles are assumed to play a major role in future mobility concepts. Although sales numbers are increasing, little emphasis has been laid on the recycling of some key components such as power electronics or electric motors. Permanent magnet synchronous motors contain considerable amounts of rare earth elements that cannot be recovered in conventional recycling routes. Although their recycling could have large economic, environmental, and strategic advantages, no industrial recycling for permanent magnets is available in western countries at the moment. Regarding the essential steps, dismantling of electric vehicles as well as the extraction of magnets from the rotors, little has been published before. This paper therefore presents and discusses different recycling approaches for the recycling of NdFeB magnets from (hybrid) electric vehicles. Many results stem from the German research project ""Recycling of components and strategic metals of electric drive motors.""."
Medical , Parkinson's Disease  , Parkinson's disease; dyskinesia; adenosine A(2A) receptor; striatum; glutamic acid decarboxylase        ,"(L)-3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine ((L)-DOPA) remains the primary pharmacological agent for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the development of (L)-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) limits the long-term use of (L)-DOPA for PD patients. Some data have reported that adenosine A(2A) receptor (A(2A)R) antagonists prevented LID in animal model of PD. However, the mechanism in which adenosine A(2A)R blockade alleviates the symptoms of LID has not been fully clarified. Here, we determined to knock out (KO) the gene of A(2A)R and explored the possible underlying mechanisms implicated in development of LID in a mouse model of PD. A(2A)R gene KO mice were unilaterally injected into the striatum with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in order to damage dopamine neurons on one side of the brain. 6-OHDA-lesioned mice were then injected once daily for 21 days with (L)-DOPA. Abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) were evaluated on days 3, 8, 13, and 18 after (L)-DOPA administration, and real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65 and GAD67 were performed. We found that A(2A)R gene KO was effective in reducing AIM scores and accompanied with decrease of striatal GAD67, rather than GAD65. These results demonstrated that the possible mechanism involved in alleviation of AIM symptoms by A(2A)R gene KO might be through reducing the expression of striatal GAD67."
CS , Computer vision  , Tea category identification; computer vision; color histogram; wavelet packet entropy; winner-takes-all; radial basis function; artificial neural network; pattern recognition; support vector machine        ,"(Objective) In order to increase classification accuracy of tea-category identification (TCI) system, this paper proposed a novel approach. (Method) The proposed methods first extracted 64 color histogram to obtain color information, and 16 wavelet packet entropy to obtain the texture information. With the aim of reducing the 80 features, principal component analysis was harnessed. The reduced features were used as input to generalized eigenvalue proximal support vector machine (GEPSVM). Winner-takes-all (WTA) was used to handle the multiclass problem. Two kernels were tested, linear kernel and Radial basis function (RBF) kernel. Ten repetitions of 10-fold stratified cross validation technique were used to estimate the out-of-sample errors. We named our method as GEPSVM + RBF + WTA and GEPSVM + WTA. (Result) The results showed that PCA reduced the 80 features to merely five with explaining 99.90% of total variance. The recall rate of GEPSVM + RBF + WTA achieved the highest overall recall rate of 97.9%. (Conclusion) This was higher than the result of GEPSVM + WTA and other five state-of-the-art algorithms: back propagation neural network, RBF support vector machine, genetic neural-network, linear discriminant analysis, and fitness-scaling chaotic artificial bee colony artificial neural network."
biochemistry , Molecular biology  , Brain-machine interfaces; Electrical stimulation of the brain; Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Trends; Psychiatry        ,"(R)ecent advances in deep brain stimulators and brain -machine interfaces have greatly expanded the possibilities of neuroprosthetics and neuromodulation. Together with advances in neuroengineering, nanotechnology, molecular biology and material sciences, it is now possible to address fundamental questions in neuroscience in new, more powerful ways. It is now possible to apply these new technologies in ways that range from augmenting and restoring function to neuromodulation modalities that treat neuropsychiatric disorders. Recent developments in neuromodulation methods offer significant advantages and potential clinical benefits for a variety of disorders. Here we describe the current state of the art in neuromodulation methods, and some advances in brain -machine interfaces, describing the advantages and limitations of the clinical applications of each method. The future applications of these new methods and how they will shape the future of psychiatry and medicine, along with safety and ethical implications, are also discussed. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

ECE , Satellite radio  , Software-defined radio; AIS receiver; VHF data exchange services; Satellite radio applications; Flexible RF front end        ,"(T)his paper presents the concept of a software-defined radio with a flexible RF front end. The design and architecture of this system, as well as possible application examples will be explained. One specific scenario is the operation in maritime frequency bands. A well-known service is the Automatic Identification System (AIS), which has been captured by the DLR mission AISat, and will be chosen as a maritime application example. The results of an embedded solution for AIS on the SDR platform are presented in this paper. Since there is an increasing request for more performance on maritime radio bands, services like AIS will be enhanced by the International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities (IALA). The new VHF Data Exchange Service (VDES) shall implement a dedicated satellite link. This paper describes that the SDR with a flexible RF front end can be used as a technology demonstration platform for this upcoming data exchange service."
MAE , Fluid mechanics  , plumes/thermals; turbulence modelling; turbulence simulation        ,"(We develop a generalised unsteady plume theory and compare it with a new direct numerical simulation (DNS) dataset for an ensemble of statistically unsteady turbulent plumes. The theoretical framework described in this paper generalises previous models and exposes several fundamental aspects of the physics of unsteady plumes. The framework allows one to understand how the structure of the governing integral equations depends on the assumptions one makes about the radial dependence of the longitudinal velocity, turbulence and pressure. Consequently, the ill-posed models identified by Scase & Hewitt (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 697, 2012, pp. 455-480) are shown to be the result of a non-physical assumption regarding the velocity profile. The framework reveals that these ill-posed unsteady plume models are degenerate cases amongst a comparatively large set of well-posed models that can be derived from the generalised unsteady plume equations that we obtain. Drawing on the results of DNS of a plume subjected to an instantaneous step change in its source buoyancy flux, we use the framework in a diagnostic capacity to investigate the properties of the resulting travelling wave. In general, the governing integral equations are hyperbolic, becoming parabolic in the limiting case of a 'top-hat' model, and the travelling wave can be classified as lazy, pure or forced according to the particular assumptions that are invoked to close the integral equations. Guided by observations from the DNS data, we use the framework in a prognostic capacity to develop a relatively simple, accurate and well-posed model of unsteady plumes that is based on the assumption of a Gaussian velocity profile. An analytical solution is presented for a pure straight-sided plume that is consistent with the key features observed from the DNS."
Psychology  , Prenatal development  , Stomach of human fetus; Development; Endocrine cells; Immunohistochemistry        ,", while ghrelin cells were the most numerous during the se Since reports on endocrine cells and their kinetics in the corpus of the human stomach are limited, the aim of this study was to examine the appearance, localization, density, and the relationship among the endocrine cell types in the corpus of the human stomach during prenatal and early postnatal development. We examined chromogranin A, somatostatin, ghrelin, glucagon, and serotonin expression by immunohistochemistry in 2 embryos, 38 fetuses, and 3 infants in the corpus of human stomach. Chromogranin A secreting endocrine cells were identified in the corpus at week 10 of gestation. Somatostatin cells were present from the 10th week, ghrelin and serotonin cells from the 11th week, and glucagon cells from the 12th week of gestation. Endocrine cells were present individually or clustered within the glandular base and body during the first trimester, and were present separately within the basal and central parts of glands during the second and third trimesters. Somatostatin cells were the most common type of cells (similar to 46 %) during the first trimestercond trimester (similar to 34 %), and in infants (similar to 28 %). The percentage of glucagon cells was significant only during the first trimester of pregnancy (5.5 %), and the percentage of serotonin cells was only significant just before birth (4.8 %). These results show, for the first time, that the largest number of endocrine cells are present in the corpus during the first trimester of prenatal development. Also, these results suggest that secretory products of endocrine cells play a role in the regulation of homeostasis, growth, and differentiation, and in human stomach function."
Medical , Sprains and Strains  , National Electronic Injury Surveillance System; water sports; trauma        ,",Background: The objective was to describe the patterns and mechanisms of water tubing related injuries treated in U.S. emergency departments. Methods: The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System was used to examine cases of water tubing related injuries. Sample weights were used to calculate national estimates of water tubing related injuries. Analyses were conducted in 2010. Results: From 1991-2009 an estimated 69,471 injuries were treated in US emergency departments for water tubing related injuries. The annual number of cases increased 250% over the 19-year study period (P<.001). Sprains and strains accounted for the largest portion of injuries (27.2%). The head was the most frequently injured body part (27.5%). Children and adolescents= 20 years, were more likely than individuals 19 years to sustain sprains and strains (OR: 2.11; 95% CI = 1.64-2.71) and were most commonly injured by impact with the water (54.6%). Conclusions: Patterns of water tubing related injuries differ for children and adults. Research is needed to determine how best to reduce these injuries."
biochemistry , Enzymology  , enzymology; factor IXa; hemophilia; structure; substrate; thrombosis        ,". Background: A key feature of factorIXa is its allosteric transformation from an enzymatically latent form into a potent procoagulant. Although several small molecules have been found to be capable of partially affecting FIXa function (i.e. ethylene glycol, Ca2+, and low molecular weight heparin [LMWH]), the resulting modest changes in peptidolytic activity have made the study of their mechanisms of action challenging. As these effects provide hints about potential regulatory forces that may be operational in the full expression of FIXa coagulant activity, their description remains of great interest. Studies of crystal structures have yielded insights into the structural changes induced by these effectors, but there remains a paucity of information to correlate any given structural change with specific consequences for FIXa function.Objectives: To correlate structural changes induced by these modulators with defined consequences for FIXa substrate discrimination and function.Methods: A peptidomics-based mass spectrometry (MS) approach was used to examine the patterns of hydrolysis of four combinatorial chemistry-derived pentapeptide libraries by FIXa under various conditions in a soluble, active enzyme system.Results: Ethylene glycol specifically altered the S3 subsite of FIXa to render it more tolerant to side chains at the P3 substrate position, whereas Ca2+ enhanced tolerance at the S2 subsite. In contrast, LMWH altered both the S2 and S1' subsites.Conclusions: These results demonstrate the role of plasticity in regulating FIXa function with respect to discrimination of extended substrate sequences, as well as providing crucial insights into active site modulations that may be capitalized on by various physiologic cofactors of FIXa and in future drug design."
biochemistry , Southern blotting  , bioinformatics approaches; causal missense mutation; gene F8; genetic counselling; haemophilia A; HAMSTeRS database        ,". Haemophilia A (HA) is caused by widespread mutations in the factor VIII gene. The high spontaneous mutation rate of this gene means that roughly 40% of HA mutations are private. This study aimed to describe the approaches used to confirm private disease-causing mutations in a cohort of Belgian HA patients. We studied 148 unrelated HA families for the presence of intron 22 and intron 1 inversion by Southern blotting and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay was used to detect large genomic rearrangements. Detection of point mutations was performed by DNA sequencing. Predicting the causal impact of new non-synonymous changes was studied by two general strategies: (i) molecular approaches such as family cosegregation, evaluation of the implicated codon based on phylogenic separated species and absence of the mutation in the general Belgian population, and (ii) bioinformatics approaches to analyse the potential functional consequences of missense mutations. Among the 148 HA patients, in addition to common intron 22 and intron 1 inversions as well as large deletions or duplications, 67 different point mutations were identified, of which 42 had been reported in the HAMSTeRS database, and 25 were novel including 10 null variants for which RNA analyses confirmed the causal effect of mutations located in a splice site consensus and 15 missense mutations whose causality was demonstrated by molecular approaches and bioinformatics. This article reports several strategies to evaluate the deleterious consequences of unreported F8 substitutions in a large cohort of HA patients."
biochemistry , Southern blotting  , age-related macular degeneration; genetics; retina; telomere        ,". Purpose: To evaluate the association between telomere length and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Methods: Circulating leucocyte telomere length and the proportion of telomeres <5kb were analysed in blood DNA samples taken from 121 patients with exudative AMD (83%), large drusen (14%) or central geographic atrophy (3%). Controls consisted of 77 age-matched subjects without AMD. The AMD status was assessed by a masked analysis of fundus photographs or angiographs. Telomere length was measured by Southern blotting. Results: Mean (SD) telomere length was 7.76kb (0.68) in AMD patients and 7.83 (0.69) in controls (p=0.485). The corresponding proportions of telomeres <5kb were 10.60 (2.76) and 10.05 (2.64) (p=0.197). In this material, there was no correlation between telomere length and age, gender or smoking status. There were no differences between the major AMD risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the CFH, HTRA1 or C3 genes, expect for somewhat longer telomeres in controls with the C3 risk SNP. There were no differences in telomere length between patients with drusen or exudative AMD. Conclusions: Telomere length is not associated with exudative AMD or high-risk drusen."
ECE , Satellite radio  , statistical tomography; high-latitude ionosphere; kilometer-scale irregularities        ,[1] First results are reported on statistical tomography of kilometer-scale irregularities in the F layer high-latitude ionosphere from amplitude data of satellite radio probing. Basic formulae for statistical tomography of three-dimensionally (3-D) anisotropic small-scale irregularities are presented. It is shown that 3-D anisotropy disguises spatial distribution of irregularities but is not an insuperable difficulty for tomographic reconstruction. An example is shown of imaging the spatial distribution of the variance of electron density fluctuations over the Kola peninsula in February 1996. Iterative procedure of tomographic inversion was used in the reconstruction. Further steps of applying statistical tomographic approach are outlined.
Medical , Cancer  , Fluorocholine; Positron emission tomography; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Phosphatidylcholine; Fatty acids        ,"[F-18]fluorocholine PET/CT can detect hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on imaging the initial steps of phosphatidylcholine synthesis. To relate the diagnostic performance of [F-18]fluorocholine positron emission tomography (PET)/x-ray computed tomography (CT) to the phospholipid composition of liver tumors, radiopathologic correspondence was performed in patients with early-stage liver cancer who had undergone [F-18]fluorocholine PET/CT before tumor resection. Tumor and adjacent liver were profiled by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, quantifying phosphatidylcholine species by mass-to-charge ratio. For clinical-radiopathologic correlation, HCC profiles were reduced to two orthogonal principal component factors (PCF1 and PCF2) accounting for 80 % of total profile variation. Tissues from 31 HCC patients and 4 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) patients were analyzed, revealing significantly higher levels of phosphocholine, CDP-choline, and highly saturated phosphatidylcholine species in HCC tumors relative to adjacent liver and ICC tumors. Significant loading values for PCF1 corresponded to phosphatidylcholines containing poly-unsaturated fatty acids while PCF2 corresponded only to highly saturated phosphatidylcholines. Only PCF2 correlated significantly with HCC tumor-to-liver [F-18]fluorocholine uptake ratio (rho = 0.59, p < 0.0005). Sensitivity for all tumors based on an abnormal [F-18]fluorocholine uptake ratio was 93 % while sensitivity for HCC based on increased tumor [F-18]fluorocholine uptake was 84 %, with lower levels of highly saturated phosphatidylcholines in tumors showing low [F-18]fluorocholine uptake. Most HCC tumors contain high levels of saturated phosphatidylcholines, supporting their dependence on de novo fatty acid metabolism for phospholipid membrane synthesis. While [F-18]fluorocholine PET/CT can serve to identify these lipogenic tumors, its imperfect diagnostic sensitivity implies metabolic heterogeneity across HCC and a weaker lipogenic phenotype in some tumors."
biochemistry , Enzymology  , [FeFe]-hydrogenase; kinetics; enzymology; electron bifurcation; time-resolved infrared spectroscopy        ,"[FeFd]-hydrogenases catalyze the reversible production of hydrogen gas from protons and electrons, but the mechanism of catalysis is still the subject of debate. In this report, we describe a pre-steady-state photoreduction methodology for correlating putative intermediates to the reactivity of an [FeFe]-hydrogenase from Thermotoga maritima. In this method, MV+ is rapidly formed photochemically by pulsed laser excitation and the intermolecular ET and active site dynamics are followed by nanosecond time-resolved visible and infrared spectroscopy, respectively. The results kinetically validate the H-ox H-red and H-sred intermediates, strongly supporting a vast body of literature on their involvement in proton reduction."
biochemistry , Northern blotting  , nonalcoholic fatty liver; Chinese herbal; uncoupling protein 2        ,"[Objective] To investigate the effect of cordyceps sinensis (CS) on expression of uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) and so to elucidate the role of UCP2 in development of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). [Methods] Rats were administrated with high-fat diet to produce NAFLD animal model and intervened by cordyceps sinensis. Triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC) in liver were measured by biochemistry, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by luciferin-luciferinase, and UCP2 expression by Northern blotting and immunohistochemistry. Liver histopathology was evaluated. [Results] High-fat diet fed rats developed obesity and showed a gradual increase in body weight, liver index, and a decrease in ATP level. More advanced liver disease was found histopathologically for longer high-fat diet. Up-regulation of liver UCP2 by high-fat diet stopped after week 12. However codyceps sinensis induced UCP2 up-regulation continuously, and kept liver ATP a relatively high level. [Conclusion] NAFLD rat models were produced successfully. Liver UCP2 up-regulation in NAFLD rats may be a definite beneficial adaptation to lipid exposure. Cordyceps sinensis may serve a protective role to prevent NAFLD from progression. One of the possible mechanisms involves in modulating UCP2 expression and thereby, regulating fat metabolism, energy homeostasis."
Medical , Sports Injuries  , Elastic therapeutic tape; Material properties; Tension test        ,"[Purpose] Elastic therapeutic tape has been widely used for rehabilitation and treatment of sports injuries. Tapes with different elastic properties serve different treatment purposes with inappropriate tension reducing tape effectiveness. Many tapes are available in the market, but studies on tape properties are limited. The aim of this study was to examine the material properties of elastic therapeutic tape. [Subjects and Methods] Brands of elastic therapeutic tape included KinesioTex (R), ATex, Mueller, 3M, and ThaiTape. The Material Testing System Insight (R) 1 Electromechanical Testing Systems was used to apply a tensile force on elastic therapeutic tape. Ten specimens of each brand were tested. Stress, load, and Young's modulus at 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, and maximum point were collected. One-way analysis of variance with post hoc testing was used to analyze tape parameters. [Results] Maximum elongation and Young's modulus at all percentages were significantly different between brands. There were no differences in maximum load and maximum stress. [Conclusion] Mechanical properties are different for commercial elastic therapeutic tapes. Physiotherapists and other clinicians should be aware of mechanical tape properties to correctly apply kinesio tape."
biochemistry , Polymerase chain reaction  , Anguilla spp; aquaculture; Comacchio Lagoon; global stressors; local stressors; population decline        ,"1. Several eel species have undergone extensive declines at both local and global level. The aim of this study was to identify the reasons for the collapse of the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) stock in an important area for biodiversity conservation (Comacchio Lagoon, Italy), in order to support the development of eel conservation plans. 2. The records of silver eel catches from Comacchio describe the total migratory population and cover the period 1781- 2013. The data are accompanied by information related to habitat loss and other local factors. The role of local factors on the decline of the local stock was investigated, while additional information from the literature was also used to discuss the effects of global factors (including glass eel harvest for aquaculture, climateoceanographic changes, habitat loss, pollution and parasitism) on the three eel species A. anguilla, Anguilla japonica and Anguilla rostrata. 3. The records from Comacchio provided significant information about the effects of local factors on the local eel populations in the past. However, the current population collapse, which started in the 1970s, could not be explained by local factors. 4. The literature on global factors suggests that the three eel species are under combined threat from various factors. The correlations between European aquaculture production data compared with the Comacchio yields and published data from other European eel and glass eel fisheries were found to be highly significant. Aquaculture, which depends entirely on wild- caught glass eels, seems to play a key role in the decline of natural stocks. 5. Conservative estimates using FAO data showed that the current numbers of glass eels needed to support aquaculture production in Europe and Asia exceeds 2 x 109 specimens. This requirement, largely supplied by A. anguilla glass eels, can explain the decline of eel populations since the glass eel trade has been expanded at an international level.

biochemistry , Genetics  , determinants of plant community diversity and structure; ecological genetics and ecogenomics; gene expression; legumes; mutualism; niche differentiation; plant-plant interactions; plant-soil (below-ground) interactions; roots; third-party interactions        ,"1. Species coexistence requires differential response to inter-and intraspecific competition, typically conceptualized as niche differentiation. Coexistence of close relatives therefore poses an interesting scenario with regards to niche differentiation since these species generally have many traits in common due to shared ancestry. Native Californian Trifolium assemblages are locally diverse and represent a unique system for understanding competitive interactions among close relatives. 2. We conducted two similar greenhouse studies in which Trifolium fucatum was grown alone, with a con-specific competitor, and with a congeneric competitor (Trifolium macraei). In the first study, we assessed biomass production in T. fucatum, and in the second study we conducted an RNAseq analysis of T. fucatum roots to test for differentially expressed genes that may mediate competitive interactions and potentially coexistence. 3. Compared to plants grown alone, competition (i.e. growth in the same pot) with a conspecific resulted in a greater reduction in biomass than competition with a congener, as predicted by theory. However, competition with a congener resulted in twice as many differentially expressed genes as competition with a conspecific. 4. Annotations of identified genes differentiating congeneric from conspecific competition suggest several functions attributed to interactions with third-party organisms, including nodulation with rhizobial mutualists, and defence responses against pathogens and herbivores. In addition, salt-responsive genes and an iron transporter were differentially expressed in congeneric competition, and comparisons of sodium and iron concentrations in field soils where these species are found showed that T. fucatum occurs in higher sodium and iron microsites than T. macraei. Thus, the transcriptome highlighted abiotic niche axes worth pursuing in future ecological experiments as potential mediators of coexistence. 5. We also found a subset of genes that responded similarly to both congeneric and conspecific competition in both direction and magnitude, indicating some conserved responses to competition, regardless of neighbour identity. 6. Synthesis. Transcriptomic analyses represent novel tools for identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying interactions among species. Working iteratively with ecological experimentation and observation, transcriptomes may allow us to identify novel dimensions of the n-dimensional niche that determine species' distributions and their ability to coexist."
CS , Machine learning  , distribution; endangered species; groundwater; invertebrates; stream; urban development        ,"1. Species distribution modelling can be useful for the conservation of rare and endangered species. Freshwater mussel declines have thinned species ranges producing spatially fragmented distributions across large areas. Spatial fragmentation in combination with a complex life history and heterogeneous environment makes predictive modelling difficult. 2. A machine learning approach (maximum entropy) was used to model occurrences and suitable habitat for the federally endangered dwarf wedgemussel, Alasmidonta heterodon, in Maryland's Coastal Plain catchments. Landscape- scale predictors (e. g. land cover, land use, soil characteristics, geology, flow characteristics, and climate) were used to predict the suitability of individual stream segments for A. heterodon. 3. The best model contained variables at three scales: minimum elevation (segment scale), percentage Tertiary deposits, low intensity development, and woody wetlands (sub- catchment), and percentage low intensity development, pasture/ hay agriculture, and average depth to the water table (catchment). Despite a very small sample size owing to the rarity of A. heterodon, cross- validated prediction accuracy was 91%. 4. Most predicted suitable segments occur in catchments not known to contain A. heterodon, which provides opportunities for new discoveries or population restoration. These model predictions can guide surveys toward the streams with the best chance of containing the species or, alternatively, away from those streams with little chance of containing A. heterodon. 5. Developed reaches had low predicted suitability for A. heterodon in the Coastal Plain. Urban and exurban sprawl continues to modify stream ecosystems in the region, underscoring the need to preserve existing populations and to discover and protect new populations.

biochemistry , Genetics  , biodiversity; invertebrates; genetics; monitoring; river; stream        ,"1. Species diversity is declining more rapidly in freshwater ecosystems than in any other, but the consequences for genetic diversity, and hence evolutionary potential, are poorly understood. In part this reflects limited use and development of modern molecular tools and genetic approaches to address conservation questions in rivers, lakes and wetlands. As widespread, diverse and functionally important organisms, freshwater macroinvertebrates are ideal candidates for genetic approaches to reveal, for example, the conservation consequences of demographic histories and past disturbances. However, the availability of microsatellite markers for this group is very limited. 2. Using next generation sequencing, microsatellite markers were developed for Isoperla grammatica (Poda, 1761), Amphinemura sulcicollis (Stephens, 1836) and Baetis rhodani (Pictet, 1843) to enable conservation genetic investigations of these widespread invertebrate species. Fifty-two robust microsatellite loci were developed (18, 21 and 13 per species), all with high levels of allelic diversity (7-27, 3-16, 5-13 alleles per loci, respectively). 3. These tools will allow assessment of genetic structure, dispersal and demographic resilience in these model species as a function of environmental change and variation, thereby aiding freshwater monitoring and conservation. The authors urge further capacity building to support genetic applications to the conservation biology of other aquatic organisms. Copyright # 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
Medical , Low Testosterone  , Chlamydiae; disease ecology; immunocompetence handicap hypothesis; microbiome; sexually transmitted disease; testosterone        ,"1. Testosterone mediates several key aspects of male reproduction, but maintaining high testosterone levels can reduce long-term survival. One of the proposed pathways by which testosterone can influence survival is through increased risk of parasite infection. The hormone has the potential to affect the transmission of sexually transmitted infections by promoting behaviours that increase sexual contact rates and/or by decreasing immune function. 2. We hypothesized that males with high concentrations of testosterone would increase their chances of being infected with sexually transmitted bacteria, which would manifest as increased diversity of cloacal bacteria. To test this hypothesis, we measured circulating testosterone concentrations in breeding male rufous-collared sparrows (Zonotrichia capensis) and collected cloacal swabs to quantify bacterial diversity using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. 3. There was a positive correlation between testosterone concentrations and the phylogenetic diversity of cloacal bacteria. In addition, individuals with high and medium testosterone concentrations had cloacal bacterial communities that were more similar to each other than to those of low testosterone individuals. Finally, when considering bacterial taxa that are potential avian pathogens, we found that the relative abundance of Chlamydiae, a class of obligate intracellular parasites, was positively correlated with testosterone concentrations. 4. Two non-exclusive explanations for these results are that testosterone affects behaviours that lead to increased sexual contacts and thus the exposure and acquisition of additional phylogenetically diverse bacteria, and/or that testosterone is altering the immune system or the cloacal environment, thus making it easier for bacteria to colonize. Either way, these data suggest that increased exposure to sexually transmitted pathogens in the form of cloacal bacteria could be a cost of maintaining high testosterone levels."
Medical , Fungal Infection  , climate change; herbivore-induced plant volatiles; multitrophic interactions; natural enemies; parasitoids; predators        ,"1. The attraction of natural enemies towards herbivore-induced plant volatiles is a well-documented phenomenon. However, the majority of published studies are carried under optimal water and nutrient regimes and with just one herbivore. But what happens when additional levels of ecological complexity are added? Does the presence of a second herbivore, microorganisms, and abiotic stress interfere with plant-natural enemy communication? or is communication stable enough to withstand disruption by additional biotic and abiotic factors? 2. Investigating the effects of these additional levels of ecological complexity is key to understanding the stability of tritrophic interactions in natural ecosystems and may aid to forecast the impact of environmental disturbances on these, especially in climate change scenarios, which are often associated with modifications in plant and arthropod species distribution and increased levels of abiotic stress. 3. This review explores the literature on natural enemy attraction to herbivore-induced volatiles when, besides herbivory, plants are challenged by additional biotic and abiotic factors. 4. The aim of this review was to establish the impact of different biotic and abiotic factors on plant-natural enemy communication and to highlight critical aspects to guide future research efforts."

The prevalence of diabetes and the other metabolic disorders has noticeably increased worldwide. A causal link between increasing risk of type 2 diabetes and exposure to environmental pollutants has been reported. 2. We hypothesized that exposure to methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), an oxygenate additive to gasoline would hinder zinc and glucose homeostasis in rats. 3. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received MTBE in drinking water for 90 days. At the end of the treatment, pancreas and blood samples were collected for biochemical and molecular examinations. Expression of four candidate genes, including Insulin1, Insulin2, MT1A, SLC30A8 by Real-Time Quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) as well as biochemical parameters, including fasting blood glucose (FBS), triglycerides (TG), cholesterol (CHO), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), copper (Cu2+) and calcium (Ca2+) levels as well as High-sensitive C-reactive protein were assessed as endpoints. 4. This study suggested that MTBE exposure can be associated with disruption in zinc homeostasis and glucose tolerance."

The quail is a potentially important avian model for molecular studies; a major drawback is the inability to sex visually before 3 weeks of age. Molecular sexing is therefore an absolute requirement when animals are sampled before that age.2. A low-cost method using common laboratory equipment based on Allele-Specific Multiplex-Polymerase Chain Reaction was developed to undertake reliable molecular identification of the sex of Coturnix japonica directly at hatching.3. This simple method works with down feathers collected from behind the neck of the newly hatched quail and includes internal controls during the PCR to limit risks of error. Males and females can be discriminated on the basis of the presence of one or two amplicons, respectively."
MAE , Hydraulics  , cavitation; hydraulic conductivity; safety margin; vulnerability segmentation; water potential        ,"1. Vulnerability segmentation hypothesis proposes that plant branches are more resistant to cavitation than their terminal leaves, namely, the difference in vulnerability to cavitation between branches and their terminal leaves is positive (P50leaf-branch>0). This allows leaves to act as safety valves to protect hydraulic pathway from dysfunction. 2. Recent studies showed that several species from humid regions have negative values of P50leaf-branch, indicating a lack of vulnerability segmentation in these species (LVS species). 3. We hypothesize that compared with species from humid regions, vulnerability segmentation is critical and necessary for arid species to survive droughts, but LVS species may take compensatory hydraulic strategies to maintain safety margins during drought periods. 4. We compile branch and leaf hydraulic trait data of 69 broadleaved woody species belonging to different biomes with contrasting climatic conditions as indicated by variable aridity index (AI), and we find that P50leaf-branch becomes small and even negative with the increase of AI. Although leaves of LVS species may lose their function as safety valves, their deep rooting, great hydraulic conductivity, and/or high stem capacitance features are critical for them to maintain hydraulic safety. 5. The results indicate that vulnerability segmentation is evidently common for species from arid regions, but not necessarily the case for some species from humid regions. With robust cavitation-resistant leaves and effective hydraulic compensatory strategies, LVS species can maintain water supply and the functionality of leaves, thus giving them a hydraulic advantage over counterparts in the face of potential drought stress.

CS , Data structures  , comparative methods; macroevolution; Open Tree of Life; phylogenetics        ,"1. While phylogenies have been getting easier to build, it has been difficult to reuse, combine and synthesize the information they provide because published trees are often only available as image files, and taxonomic information is not standardized across studies. 2. The Open Tree of Life (OTL) project addresses these issues by providing a digital tree that encompasses all organisms, built by combining taxonomic information and published phylogenies. The project also provides tools and services to query and download parts of this synthetic tree, as well as the source data used to build it. Here, we present rot1, an R package to search and download data fromthe Open Tree of Life directly in R. 3. rot1 uses common data structures allowing researchers to take advantage of the rich set of tools and methods that are available in R to manipulate, analyse and visualize phylogenies. Here, and in the vignettes accompanying the package, we demonstrate how rot1 can be used with other R packages to analyse biodiversity data. 4. As phylogenies are being used in a growing number of applications, rot1 facilitates access to phylogenetic data and allows their integration with statistical methods and data sources available inR."

Stochastic modeling is a new step in large data analysis that serves extracting cell biology concepts. We review here Smoluchowski's approach to stochastic processes and provide several applications for coarse-graining diffusion, studying polymer models for understanding nuclear organization and finally, we discuss the stochastic jump dynamics of telomeres across cell division and stochastic gene regulation."

Recent in vitro experiments suggested that human 11 beta-HSD1 metabolizes the secondary bile acid 7-oxolithocholic acid (7-oxoLCA) to chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and minor amounts of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Here, we provide evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies for a major role of 11 beta-HSD1 in the oxidoreduction of 7-oxoLCA and compare its level and metabolism in several species. Hepatic microsomes from liver-specific 11 beta-HSD1-deficient mice were devoid of 7-oxoLCA oxidoreductase activity. Importantly, circulating and intrahepatic levels of 7-oxoLCA and its taurine conjugate were significantly elevated in mouse models of 11 beta-HSD1 deficiency. Moreover, comparative enzymology of 11 beta-HSD1-dependent oxidoreduction of 7-oxoLCA revealed that the guinea-pig enzyme is devoid of 7-oxoLCA oxidoreductase activity. Unlike in other species, 7-oxoLCA and its glycine conjugate are major bile acids in guinea-pigs.(jlr) In conclusion, the oxidoreduction of 7-oxoLCA and its conjugated metabolites are catalyzed by 11 beta-HSD1, and the lack of this activity leads to the accumulation of these bile acids in guinea-pigs and 11 beta-HSD1-deficient mice. Thus, 7-oxoLCA and its conjugates may serve as biomarkers of impaired 11 beta-HSD1 activity."
Medical , Parenting  , Parenting; Stress; Co-parenting; Feeding; Autism        ,"113 parents of children aged 5-13 with ASD completed online surveys assessing co-parenting quality, parenting stress, and child feeding challenges. Results indicated that food selectivity was both the most frequently reported type of challenging feeding behavior and the most often reported as problematic but was also the only type of challenging feeding behavior that was not associated with parenting stress. Greater parenting stress was reported when co-parenting agreement and support were lower. Child disruptive behavior at mealtime was the only feeding challenge associated with quality of co-parenting. This paper points to the importance of addressing feeding challenges in addition to selectivity, such as disruptive mealtime behaviors, and doing so within the context of the family and home environment."
biochemistry , Enzymology  , Eicosanoids; Lipid peroxidation; Molecular enzymology; Structural biology; Motional flexibility; Thermal stability        ,"12/15-Lipoxygenases (12/15-LOXs) have been implicated in inflammatory and hyperproliferative diseases but the structural biology of these enzymes is not well developed. Most LOXs constitute single polypeptide chain proteins that fold into a two-domain structure. In the crystal structure the two domains are tightly associated, but small angle X-ray scattering data and dynamic fluorescence studies suggested a high degree of structural flexibility involving movement of the N-terminal domain relative to catalytic subunit. When we inspected the interdomain interface we have found a limited number of side-chain contacts which are involved in interactions of these two structural subunits. One of such contact points involves tyrosine 98 of N-terminal domain. This aromatic amino acid is invariant in vertebrate LOXs regardless of overall sequence identity. To explore in more detail the role of aromatic interactions in interdomain association we have mutated Y98 to various residues and quantified the structural and functional consequences of these alterations. We have found that loss of an aromatic moiety at position 98 impaired the catalytic activity and membrane binding capacity of the mutant enzymes. Although CD and fluorescence emission spectra of wild-type and mutant enzyme species were indistinguishable, the mutation led to enlargement of the molecular shape of the enzyme as detected by analytic gel filtration and this structural alteration was shown to be associated with a loss of protein thermal stability. The possible role of tight interdomain association for the enzyme's structural performance is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

However, MIBG has a serious disadvantage in that it demands a long examination time. The objective of this study was to evaluate statistically the usefulness of the heart/ mediastinum ratio (H/M) from the early phase of MIBG for the differential diagnosis of DLB. In total, 113 patients were examined, including 32 non-DLB (19 with Alzheimer's dementia) and 79 DLB patients. The mean early-H/M ratio was 2.83 in the non-DLB group and 1.95 in the DLB group. The mean delayed-H/M ratio was 3.0 in the non-DLB group and 1.76 in the DLB group. With a cutoff point of 2.27 on early images, the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy were 65%, 94%, and 73%, respectively, and the area under the curve was 0.82, indicating moderate accuracy. This analysis indicates that images from the early phase of MIBG alone are sufficient for the differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and DLB."
Medical , Birth Control  , Egg production; Fundulus heteroclitus; Mummichog; Fertilization success; Vitellogenin induction        ,"17 alpha-Ethinylestradiol (EE2) is a potent estrogen used in birth-control pills. Previous laboratory and field studies have shown negative impacts in a variety of fish species after exposure to low levels of EE2, most notably a nearly complete shutdown of egg production. The present study demonstrates that mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus), a small-bodied estuarine species, is able to continue to produce eggs after exposure for 28 d to 100 ng of EE2/L. No effect of EE2 on egg production was observed, whereas a >35-fold increase in vitellogenin (vtg 1) gene expression in males was found. The lack of response in egg production in fish exposed to high levels of EE2 warrants further investigations on species-specific responses to estrogens and endocrine disruptors in general.

External genitalia range from female-like to atypical genitalia and most affected males are raised as females. Virilization in subjects with 17 beta-HSD3 deficiency occurs at the time of puberty and several of them change to male social sex. In male social sex patients, testes can be safely maintained, as long as they are positioned inside the scrotum The phenotype of 46,XY DSD due to 17 beta-HSD3 deficiency is extremely variable and clinically indistinguishable from other causes of 46,XY DSD such as partial androgen insensitivity syndrome and 5 alpha-reductase 2 deficiency. Laboratory diagnosis is based on a low testosterone/androstenedione ratio due to high serum levels of androstenedione and low levels of testosterone. The disorder is caused by a homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the HSD17B3 gene that encodes the 17 beta-HSD3 isoenzyme leading to an impairment of the conversion of 17-keto into 17-hydroxysteroids. Molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis and provides the orientation for genetic counseling. Our proposal in this article is to review-the previously reported cases of 17 beta-HSD3 deficiency adding our own cases. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd."

Mutations in. the HSD17B3 gene causing 17 beta-HSD3 deficiency are responsible for a rare recessive form of 46, XY Disorders of Sex Development (46, XY DSD). We report novel cases of Tunisian patients with 17 beta-HSD3 deficiency due to previously reported mutations, i.e. p.C206X and p.G133R, as well as a case with the novel compound heterozygous mutations p.C206X and p.Q176P. Moreover, the previously reported polymorphism p.G289S was identified in a heterozygous state in combination with a novel non-coding variant c.54G >T, also in a heterozygous state, in a male patient presenting with micropenis and low testosterone levels. The identification of four different mutations in a cohort of eight patients confirms the generally observed genetic heterogeneity of 17 beta-HSD3 deficiency. Nevertheless, analysis of DNA from 272 randomly selected healthy controls from the same geographic area (region of Sfax) revealed a high carrier frequency for the p.C206X mutation of approximately 1 in 40. Genotype reconstruction of the affected pedigree members revealed that all p. C206X mutation carriers harbored the same haplotype, indicating inheritance of the mutation from a common ancestor. Thus, the identification of a founder effect and the elevated carrier frequency of the p. C206X mutation emphasize the importance to consider this mutation in the diagnosis and genetic counseling of affected 17 beta-HSD3 deficiency pedigrees in Tunisia. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Medical , Birth Control  , 17Alpha-ethinylestradiol; Largemouth bass; Transcriptomic approach        ,"17Alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2), used for birth control in humans, is a potent estrogen that is found in wastewater at low concentrations (ng/l). EE2 has the ability to interfere with the endocrine system of fish, affecting reproduction which can result in population level effects. The objective of this study was to determine if dietary exposure to EE2 would alter gene expression patterns and key pathways in the liver and ovary and whether these could be associated with reproductive endpoints in female large-mouth bass during egg development. Female LMB received 70 ng EE2/g feed (administered at 1% of body weight) for 60 days. EE2 dietary exposure significantly reduced plasma vitellogenin concentrations by 70%. Hepatosomatic and gonadosomatic indices were also decreased with EE2 feeding by 38.5% and 40%, respectively. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that there were more changes in steady state mRNA levels in the liver compared to the ovary. Genes associated with reproduction were differentially expressed, such as vitellogenin in the liver and aromatase in the gonad. In addition, a set of genes related with oxidative stress (e.g. glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase) were identified as altered in the liver and genes associated with the immune system (e.g. complement component 1, and macrophage-inducible C-type lectin) were altered in the gonad. In a follow-up study with 0.2 ng EE2/g feed for 60 days, similar phenotypic and gene expression changes were observed that support these findings with the higher concentrations. This study provides new insights into how dietary exposure to EE2 interferes with endocrine signaling pathways in female LMB during a critical period of reproductive oogenesis. (C) 2014 Elsevier BM.

The diagnosis can be missed in early childhood as the clinical presentation may be subtle. The most frequent presentation of 17 HSD-3 deficiency is a 46,XY individual with female external genitalia, labial fusion and a blind ending vagina, with or without clitoromegaly. A low testosterone/androstenedion (T/A) ratio is suggestive of 17 beta HSD-3 deficiency, and such diagnosis can be confirmed with molecular genetic studies. A 12-day newborn was referred to our hospital because of palpable gonads in the labia majora. On physical examination, the baby had female external genitalia and palpable gonads in the labia majora. T/A ratio was 0.26 and the diagnosis was 17 beta HSD-3 deficiency, which was confirmed by the evidence of compound heterozygousity novel frameshift mutations in exon 9 and 10 of HSD17B3 gene."

In the present study, we found, by utilizing RT-PCR with RNA extracted from anti-1A6/DRIM inummoprecipitates and Northern blotting, that 1A6/DRIM is associated with U3 snoRNA. Pulse-chase labeling assays showed that silencing of 1A6/DRIM expression in HeLa cells resulted in a delayed 18S rRNA processing. Furthermore, immunoprecipitations revealed that 1A6/DRIM was also associated with fibrillarin, another U3 RNP component in HeLa cells.

Understanding the mechanism of this unique enzyme is critical for developing new anti-infective agents that selectively target isoprenoid biosynthesis. The present study used mutagenesis and a combination of protein fluorescence, CD and kinetics experiments to investigate the roles of Arg420, Arg478 and Tyr392 in substrate binding and catalysis. The results support a random sequential, preferred order mechanism, and predict that Arg420 and Arg478 are involved in binding of the acceptor substrate, GraP. D-Glyceraldehyde, an alternative acceptor substrate lacking the phosphoryl group predicted to interact with Arg420 and Arg478, also accelerates decarboxylation of the predecarboxylation intermediate C2 alpha-lactylthiamin diphosphate (LThDP) on DXP synthase, indicating that this binding interaction is not absolutely required, and that the hydroxyaldehyde sufficiently triggers decarboxylation. Unexpectedly, Tyr392 contributes to GraP affinity, and is not required for LThDP formation or its GraP-promoted decarboxylation. Time-resolved CD spectroscopy and NMR experiments indicate that LThDP is significantly stabilized on R420A and Y392F variants as compared with wild-type DXP synthase in the absence of acceptor substrate, but these substitutions do not appear to affect the rate of GraP-promoted LThDP decarboxylation in the presence of high levels of GraP, and LThDP formation remains the rate-limiting step. These results suggest a role of these residues in promoting GraP binding, which in turn facilitates decarboxylation, and also highlight interesting differences between DXP synthase and other thiamin diphosphate-dependent enzymes."

These urinary metabolites indicated that the metabolic pathways of PV9 include: (1) the reduction of ketone groups to their corresponding alcohols; (2) oxidation of the pyrrolidine ring to the corresponding pyrrolidone; (3) aliphatic oxidation of the terminal carbon atom to the corresponding carboxylate form, possibly through an alcohol intermediate (not detected); and (4) hydroxylation at the penultimate carbon atom to the corresponding alcohols followed by further oxidation to ketones, and combinations of these steps. In addition, results from the quantitative analyses of five phase-I metabolites using newly synthesized authentic standards suggested that the main metabolic pathway includes the aliphatic oxidation of terminal and/or penultimate carbons. Human metabolism of PV9 differed significantly from those of alpha-pyrrolidinovalerophenone and alpha-pyrrolidinobutiophenone, suggesting that the main metabolic pathways of alpha-pyrrolidinophenones significantly change depending on the alkyl chain length of the parent molecule."

To reveal the significant importance and smart-material functionality of the energetic-energetic co-crystals, the stability, mechanical and explosive properties TNT/CL-20 co-crystal, TNT crystal and CL-20 crystal were studied. Non-hydrogen bonded non-covalent interactions govern the structures of energetic-energetic co-crystals. However, it is very difficult to accurately calculate the non-covalent intermolecular interaction energies. In this paper, the local conformation and the intricate non-covalent interactions were effectively mapped and analyzed from the electron density (rho) and its derivatives. The results show that the two components TNT and CL-20 are connected mainly by nitro-aromatic interactions, and nitro-nitro interactions. The steric interactions in TNT/CL-20 could not be confronted with the attractive interactions. Moreover, the scatter graph of TNT crystal reveals the reason why TNT is brittle. The detailed electrostatic potential analysis predicted that the detonation velocities (D) and impact sensitivity for the compounds both increase in the sequence of CL-20 >TNT/CL-20 co-crystal >TNT. Additionally, TNT/CL-20 co-crystal has better malleability than its pure components. This demonstrates the capacity and the feasibility of realizing explosive smart materials by co-crystallization, even if strong hydrogen bonding schemes are generally lacking in energetic materials."

The aim of this article is to describe the limits in the use of Bitcoin as medium of exchange. Bitcoin network operation is carried out at high costs of electrical energy consumption, which, will over time be reflected in the price of transactions. Low transaction prices, which is one of the main arguments of Bitcoin promoters, are only possible with continuous issuance of new bitcoins to circulation. Bitcoin's - ""prove of work"" - is the most energetically demanding method from all currently existing methods securing cryptoplatforms. Halving mechanism which reduces the rewards of miners create pressure to decrease hash rate, which is a reflection of the rate of network security. The pressure to decrease hash rate is for now overrun by the increasing efficiency of mining devices. The future will therefore probably bring us fundamental questions: What will it mean for Bitcoin network, if the real costs of running the network will be reflected in costs of transaction? How will Bitcoin network be able to compete with other cryptocurrencies, whose operation is carried out at a much lower cost? Will halving mechanism ultimately cause a declined hash rate, and thereby also a reduction in network security?"

We aimed to characterize growth patterns, hypoparathyroidism, and thyroid dysfunction of individuals with 22q11.2DS. Anthropometric and laboratory measurements were obtained from the charts of 48 individuals (males=28, 8.0 +/- 6.8 visits/participant) followed at a national 22q11.2DS clinic between 2009 and 2016. Age at diagnosis was 4.3 +/- 4.9 years and age at last evaluation 11.2 +/- 7.2 years. Median height-SDS was negative at all ages. Height-SDS at last visit was correlated to the midparental height-SDS (r=0.52 P=0.002). Yet, participants did not reach their target height, with a difference of 1.06 +/- 1.07 SD (P<0.0001). Height-SDS at last visit of participants with a heart defect was lower compared to participants with a normal heart (-1.5 +/- 1.4 vs. -0.6 +/- 0.8, P=0.036), with lower height-SDS in the subgroup of participants with severe heart defects (-2.1 +/- 1.6, P=0.009). Mean IGF1-SDS was low (-0.99 +/- 1.68) but was not correlated with height-SDS. Thirteen patients (27%) had hypoparathyroidism: 10 presented during infancy and 3 during adolescence. Five patients (10.4%, female=4) had thyroid abnormalities. In conclusions, individuals with 22q11.2 DS have a distinct growth pattern consisting of growth restriction at all ages, resulting in final adult height in the low-normal range. Hypoparathyroidism is common and may present during the neonatal period as well as later in life. Thyroid abnormalities may present during childhood, adolescence, or adulthood."

The lateral shape of these 2D materials is typically considered random and irregular, and their average size is often estimated using techniques characterized by strong approximations or poor statistical significance. Here we measure in a quantitative, objective way the size and shape of 2D monoatomic nanosheets using a combination of optical, electronic and scanning probe techniques. We measure, one by one, the size and shape of thousands of sheets of graphene oxide as they undergo a standard ultrasonication treatment. Using automatic image processing and statistical modelling we identify two different fragmentation processes in 2D at the nanoscale, related to two populations of nanosheets described by gamma and exponential size distributions respectively. The two populations of sheets coexist during the fragmentation process, each one retaining its average size and shape. Our results explain the size reduction commonly observed in nanosheets upon sonication as an effect of changes in the respective weights of the two populations of nanosheets present in the material."

The d-(R)-enantiomer (d-2-HG) is an oncometabolite generated from -ketoglutarate (-KG) by mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase, whereas l-(S)-2-HG is generated by lactate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase in response to hypoxia. Because acidic pH is a common feature of hypoxia, as well as tumor and stem cell microenvironments, we hypothesized that pH may regulate cellular 2-HG levels. Herein we report that cytosolic acidification under normoxia moderately elevated 2-HG in cells, and boosting endogenous substrate -KG levels further stimulated this elevation. Studies with isolated lactate dehydrogenase-1 and malate dehydrogenase-2 revealed that generation of 2-HG by both enzymes was stimulated severalfold at acidic pH, relative to normal physiologic pH. In addition, acidic pH was found to inhibit the activity of the mitochondrial l-2-HG removal enzyme l-2-HG dehydrogenase and to stimulate the reverse reaction of isocitrate dehydrogenase (carboxylation of -KG to isocitrate). Furthermore, because acidic pH is known to stabilize hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and 2-HG is a known inhibitor of HIF prolyl hydroxylases, we hypothesized that 2-HG may be required for acid-induced HIF stabilization. Accordingly, cells stably overexpressing l-2-HG dehydrogenase exhibited a blunted HIF response to acid. Together, these results suggest that acidosis is an important and previously overlooked regulator of 2-HG accumulation and other oncometabolic events, with implications for HIF signaling."

We describe a case of 46XY ambiguous genitalia that was misdiagnosed as androgen insensitivity syndrome. The correct diagnosis was made after adrenarche. Genotyping demonstrated compound heterozygosity in two alleles, the previously described c.244G >A (p.Ala82Thr), and a novel 931C >.T(p. Gln311*) variant. We suggest that adrenarche unmasked the condition by driving cortisol production to rates that caused the mutant 3bHSD2 enzyme to become rate limiting for cortisol production. This case illustrates how markedly different the effects of this condition may be on androgen production compared with glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production. It also demonstrates how current guidelines based on urinary steroids and cortisol sufficiency may not arrive at the correct diagnosis, and underlines the importance of gene testing in the work-up of disorders of sexual differentiation."

Medical , Hepatitis C  , Feasibility study; hepatitis C risk behaviours; hepatitis C transmission knowledge; women who inject drugs; group intervention        ,"Aims: This study aimed to develop and test the feasibility, acceptability and initial effectiveness of a three-session psychosocial group intervention to reduce hepatitis C risk behaviours and increase hepatitis C transmission knowledge among women who inject drugs in five European cities/towns. Methods: An uncontrolled, field effectiveness study of a psychosocial group intervention. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission knowledge, sexual and drug risk behaviours and depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline and one-month post-intervention. Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted. Findings: One-month post-intervention, a significant increase was reported in HCV transmission knowledge and in the number of new and unused needles/syringes used to inject. There were significant reductions in the sharing of spoons/containers for mixing that had been used by someone else, sharing of filters, cookers, spoons or water with someone who was hepatitis C positive and the use of alcohol swabs following injection. Conclusions: The intervention showed promising results in reducing some hepatitis C injecting risk behaviours and increasing hepatitis C transmission knowledge among women who inject drugs. These preliminary findings suggest that it is feasible to deliver the intervention in drug treatment settings, and that the intervention was acceptable to both participants and staff."

ECE , Control engineering  , educational software tool; multivariable control; decoupling control; wind turbines        ,"This paper presents an educational software tool, called wtControlGUI, whose main purpose is to show the applicability and performance of different decoupling control strategies in wind turbines. Nowadays, wind turbines are a very important field in control engineering. Therefore, from an educational point of view, the tool also aims to improve the learning of multivariable control concepts applied on this field. In addition, wtControlGUI allows for testing and controlling of a lab-scale system which emulates the dynamic response of a large-scale wind turbine. The designed graphical user interface essentially allows simulation and experimental testing of decoupling networks and other multivariable methodologies, such as robust or decentralized control strategies. The tool is available for master degree students in control engineering. A survey was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed tool when it is used in educational related tasks.

Psychology  , False memories  , judgment; metamemory; accuracy; eyewitness memory; episodic memory; long-term memory; confidence; false memory; recognition memory        ,"Different researchers have reported positive, null, and negative relationships between confidence and accuracy in reports from memory. One possible reason for this paradox is the variety of materials used across experiments, but the two experiments reported in this article show that positive and negative confidence-accuracy correlations can be observed using a single procedure and the same materials. Subjects studied words from semantic categories and then took a recognition test while making confidence ratings. For previously studied items, positive correlations between confidence and accuracy were obtained using three different measures. Yet when confidence-accuracy correlations were assessed for unstudied items from studied categories, the correlations were zero or negative. The critical factors in determining when negative correlations will be found are the similarity of lures to presented items and the type of analysis used. These results indicate that one should be cautious about relying on confidence of recognition when rememberers must decide among highly similar events."
Psychology  , Leadership  , Implementation support; Co-occurring disorders; Fidelity; Training; Technical assistance        ,"Background: Incorporating evidence-based integrated treatment for dual disorders into typical care settings has been challenging, especially among those serving Veterans who are homeless. This paper presents an evaluation of an effort to incorporate an evidence-based, dual disorder treatment called Maintaining Independence and Sobriety Through Systems Integration, Outreach, and Networking-Veterans Edition (MISSION-Vet) into case management teams serving Veterans who are homeless, using an implementation strategy called Getting To Outcomes (GTO). Methods: This Hybrid Type III, cluster-randomized controlled trial assessed the impact of GTO over and above MISSION-Vet Implementation as Usual (IU). Both conditions received standard MISSION-Vet training and manuals. The GTO group received an implementation manual, training, technical assistance, and data feedback. The study occurred in teams at three large VA Medical Centers over 2 years. Within each team, existing sub-teams (case managers and Veterans they serve) were the clusters randomly assigned. The trial assessed MISSION-Vet services delivered and collected via administrative data and implementation barriers and facilitators, via semi-structured interview. Results: No case managers in the IU group initiated MISSION-Vet while 68% in the GTO group did. Seven percent of Veterans with case managers in the GTO group received at least one MISSION-Vet session. Most case managers appreciated the MISSION-Vet materials and felt the GTO planning meetings supported using MISSION-Vet. Case manager interviews also showed that MISSION-Vet could be confusing; there was little involvement from leadership after their initial agreement to participate; the data feedback system had a number of difficulties; and case managers did not have the resources to implement all aspects of MISSION-Vet. Conclusions: This project shows that GTO-like support can help launch new practices but that multiple implementation facilitators are needed for successful execution of a complex evidence-based program like MISSION-Vet."
CS , Bioinformatics  , secondary metabolism; bioinformatics; genome mining; Aneurinibacillus migulanus; biocontrol bacteria; gramicidin S; biosurfactant        ,"The soil-borne gram-positive bacteria Aneurinibacillus migulanus strain Nagano shows considerable potential as a biocontrol agent against plant diseases. In contrast, A. migulanus NCTC 7096 proved less effective for inhibition of plant pathogens. Nagano strain exerts biocontrol activity against some gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi and oomycetes through the production of gramicidin S (GS). Apart from the antibiotic effects, GS increases the rate of evaporation from the plant surface, reducing periods of surface wetness and thereby indirectly inhibiting spore germination. To elucidate the molecular basis of differential biocontrol abilities of Nagano and NCTC 7096, we compared GS production and biosurfactant secretion in addition to genome mining of the genomes. Our results proved that: (i) Using oil spreading, blood agar lysis, surface tension and tomato leaves wetness assays, Nagano showed increased biosurfactant secretion in comparison with NCTC 7096, (ii) Genome mining indicated the presence of GS genes in both Nagano and NCTC 7096 with two amino acid units difference between the strains: T342I and P419S. Using 3D models and the DUET server, T342I and P419S were predicted to decrease the stability of the NCTC 7096 GS synthase, (iii) Nagano produced two additional GS-like molecules GS-1155 (molecular weight 1155) and GS-1169 (molecular weight 1169), where one or two ornithine residues replace lysine in the peptide. There was also a negative correlation between surface tension and the quantity of GS-1169 present in Nagano, and (iv) the Nagano genome had a full protein network of exopolysaccharide biosynthesis in contrast to NCTC 7096 which lacked the first enzyme of the network. NCTC 7096 is unable to form biofilms as observed for Nagano. Different molecular layers, mainly gramicidin secondary metabolite production, account for differential biocontrol abilities of Nagano and NCTC 7096. This work highlighted the basis of differential biological control abilities between strains belonging to the same species and demonstrates techniques useful to the screening of effective biocontrol strains for environmentally friendly secondary metabolites that can be used to manage plant pathogens in the field."
Psychology  , Depression  , Adolescence; Expressed emotion; Psychopathology; Family; Perception        ,"Objective: To investigate the association between the perception of expressed emotion and psychopathology of school-going adolescents in a non-clinical sample. Methods: The cross-sectional field study was conducted in Kocaeli, Turkey, and comprised high-school students during the 2014-15 school years. Data was collected using the Information Collection Form, Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and Shortened Level of Expressed Emotion Scale. SPSS 21 was used for data analysis. Results: Of the 487 subjects, 295(60.57%) were girls and 192(39.43%) were boys. The overall median age was 16 (inter-quartile range: 15-17 years). There were significant positive relationships between the scales in terms of emotional problems (p<0.001), behavioural problems (p<0.001), Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (p<0.001), and peer relationship problems (p<0.001). There was also a negative significant relationship between pro-social behaviours and expressed emotion (p<0.001). Conclusion: The concept of perceived expressed emotion in non-clinical adolescents is useful in alarming clinicians and preventing mental disorders."
ECE , Electrical generator  , CO2 capture; Efficiency; Exergy; LNG (liquefied natural gas)        ,"The LNG (liquefied natural gas) regasification process is a source of cold exergy that is suitable to be recovered to improve the efficiency of thermal power plants. In this paper, an innovative power plant with LNG (liquefied natural gas) exergy utilisation and the capture of CO2 proceeding from the flue gases is presented. It is characterised by the recovery of LNG cold exergy in a closed Brayton cycle and through direct expansion in an expander coupled to an electrical generator. Moreover, this novel power plant configuration allows CO2 capture, through an oxy-fuel combustion system and a Rankine cycle that operates with the flue gases themselves and in quasi-critical conditions. The greatest advantage of this plant is that all the recoverable LNG exergy is used to increase the efficiency of the CBC (closed Brayton cycle) and in direct expansion whereas, in other power cycles found in literature that associate LNG regasification and CO2 capture, part of the LNG exergy is used for condensing flue gas CO2 for its subsequent capture. As a result, a high efficiency power plant is achieved, exceeding 65%, with almost zero greenhouse gas emissions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

The basic idea is to use distributed micro quantum computers to process respectively a small quantity of quantum states and then communicate with a given classical computer via classical channel to transport the results. We study the phase estimation algorithm basing on this idea and provide a distributed semi-quantum algorithm for phase estimation. Its time complexity in the first stage will not be worse than the existing quantum algorithm of phase estimation, and particularly, has an exponential acceleration in the second stage of phase estimation.

Medical , Ankylosing Spondylitis  , Biologic agents; Registry; Rheumatoid arthritis; Switching        ,"Despite improved quality of care for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, many still experience treatment failure with a biologic agent and eventually switch to another biologic agent. We investigated patterns of biologic treatment and reasons for switching biologics in patients with RA. Patients with RA who had started on a biologic agent or had switched to another biologic agent were identified from the prospective observational Korean nationwide Biologics (KOBIO) registry. The KOBIO registry contained 1184 patients with RA at the time of initiation or switching of biologic agents. Patients were categorized according to the chronological order of the introduction of biologic agents, and reasons for switching biologics were also evaluated. Of the 1184 patients with RA, 801 started with their first biologic agent, 228 were first-time switchers, and 89 were second-time or more switchers. Second-time or more switchers had lower rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP positivity, and higher disease activity scores at the time of enrollment than the other groups. Among these patients, tocilizumab was the most commonly prescribed biologic agent, followed by adalimumab and etanercept. The most common reason for switching biologics was inefficacy, followed by adverse events, including infusion reactions, infections, and skin eruptions. Furthermore, the proportion of inefficacy, as a reason for switching, was significantly higher with respect to switching between biologics with different mechanisms of action than between biologics with similar mechanisms. In this registry, we showed diverse prescribing patterns and differing baseline profiles based on the chronological order of biologic agents."
Medical , Depression  , Multispectral imaging; Monte Carlo simulation; reduced scattering coefficient; absorption coefficient; hemodynamics; particle sizing; tissue morphology        ,"We investigated a quantitative imaging of reduced scattering coefficients mu(s)'(lambda) and the absorption coefficients mu(a)(lambda) of in vivo cortical tissues in the range from visible to near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths based on diffuse reflectance spectral imaging technique. In this method, diffuse reflectance images of in vivo cortical tissue are acquired at nine wavelengths (500, 520, 540, 560, 570, 580, 600, 730, and 760 nm). A multiple regression analysis aided by the Monte Carlo simulation for the absorbance spectra is then utilized to estimate the optical coefficients of cortical tissue. This analysis calculates the concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin and that of deoxygenated hemoglobin, the scattering amplitude a and the scattering power b. The spectrum of absorption coefficient is deduced from the estimated concentrations of oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin. The spectrum of reduced scattering coefficient is determined by the estimated scattering amplitude and scattering power. The particle size distribution of microstructure is calculated from the estimated scattering power b for evaluating the morphological change in brain tissue quantitatively. Animal experiments with in vivo exposed brain of rats demonstrated that the responses of the absorption properties to hyperoxic and anoxic conditions are in agreement with the expected well-known cortical hemodynamics. The average particle size was significantly reduced immediately after the onset of anoxia and then it was changed into an increase, which implied the swelling and shrinkage of the cellular and subcellular structures induced by loss of tissue viability in brain tissue."
Civil , Remote Sensing  , Convolutional neural network (CNN); object localization; remote sensing images; unsupervised score-based bounding box regression (USB-BBR)        ,"In this paper, we focus on tackling the problem of automatic accurate localization of detected objects in high-resolution remote sensing images. The two major problems for object localization in remote sensing images caused by the complex context information such images contain are achieving generalizability of the features used to describe objects and achieving accurate object locations. To address these challenges, we propose a new object localization framework, which can be divided into three processes: region proposal, classification, and accurate object localization process. First, a region proposal method is used to generate candidate regions with the aim of detecting all objects of interest within these images. Then, generic image features from a local image corresponding to each region proposal are extracted by a combination model of 2-D reduction convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Finally, to improve the location accuracy, we propose an unsupervised score-based bounding box regression (USB-BBR) algorithm, combined with a nonmaximum suppression algorithm to optimize the bounding boxes of regions that detected as objects. Experiments show that the dimension-reduction model performs better than the retrained and fine-tuned models and the detection precision of the combined CNN model is much higher than that of any single model. Also our proposed USB-BBR algorithm can more accurately locate objects within an image. Compared with traditional features extraction methods, such as elliptic Fourier transform-based histogram of oriented gradients and local binary pattern histogram Fourier, our proposed localization framework shows robustness when dealing with different complex backgrounds."
biochemistry , Northern blotting  , Beet black scorch virus; infectious cDNA clone; coat protein; pathogenicity        ,"A full-length Beet black scorch virus (BBSV) cDNA clone (pUBF52) was constructed by RT-PCR. The clone contains an upstream T7 RNA polymerase promoter designed for in vitro transcription of infectious RNAs from the linearized plasmid that faithfully represent the viral cDNA. Leaves of Chenopodium amaranticolor inoculated with in vitro transcripts developed the same symptoms and disease phenotype as the wild type virus. The presence of BBSV RNA and coat protein in the leaves was confirmed respectively by Northern blotting and Western blotting. Comparisons of specific immunoreactions between the expression product of the BBSV p24 gene in E. coli and antiserum against purified BBSV virions demonstrated that the p24 gene encodes the coat protein. Based on the sequence of the pUBF52 cDNA, a frame-shift mutant and two deletion mutants were generated. One of the deletions encompasses the entire CP ORF and the other truncates 174 amino acids from the central region of the protein. Transcripts derived from the frame-shift CP mutant, which terminates the CP after the first 23 amino acids, elicited the same symptom phenotype and levels of RNA accumulation as the wild type virus, but the leaves infected with the CP deletion mutants exhibited greatly reduced RNA accumulation. In addition, leaves inoculated with in vitro transcripts of the mutant in which the entire CP gene was deleted had lower local lesions than wild type virus transcripts. Two expression vectors, pBGFP and pBGUS, were constructed by fusing the GFP and GUS genes to the 23 N-terminal amino acids of the CP gene, respectively. Leaves infected with in vitro transcripts of pBGFP and pBGUS exhibited expression of GFP and GUS proteins as assessed by laser confocal microscopy and histochemical staining, respectively. The high levels of expression of the GFP and GUS proteins provide tools that can be used for studies of replication and movement of the virus, and indicate that BBSV has considerable biotechnology potential as a plant virus expression vehicle."
Medical , Skin Care  , gloves; individual prevention; hand eczema; massage; occupational exposure; occupational health; occupational skin diseases; protection measure        ,"Background: Physiotherapists have an occupationally elevated risk of dermatoses. One aim of skin care seminars for specific professional groupsin individual prevention programme in Germany is to ensure appropriate use of safety measures during patient treatment. Initially physiotherapists often think skeptically about the use of gloves and patients' acceptance of this protective measure. So the objective of this study was to assess the practicality of glove use during physiotherapy (qualitative investigation) and customer acceptance of them during massage (quantitative investigation). Methods: Structured problem-focused interviews about glove usage were held with 20 skin diseased physiotherapists and masseurs after skin care seminars. The data was evaluated inductively using Mayring's qualitative content analysis. The clients' acceptance was tested in a controlled randomized three setting study with 120 subjects who received a back massage and evaluated quality aspects of their massage in a questionnaire. The physiotherapist was wearing either gloves of PVC, gloves made of nitrile rubber or no gloves at all. A non-inferiority test was used to test group differences. Result: The majority of participating physiotherapists considered the use of protective gloves a practical and useful measure. However, occasional problems in everyday practice and in special therapy methods were reported. The analysis of 120 questionnaires (100% response rate) for quality aspects and the willingness to pay regarding client acceptancein a massage - with or without gloves - showed a non-inferiority result for massages with gloves. Conclusion: Convincing individual physiotherapists of the benefits of wearing gloves is crucial for implementation of this preventive measure. It is improbable that patients would refuse services because therapists wear gloves during treatments. Consequently, the usage of gloves is unlikely to result in a loss of practice custom."
ECE , Electrical generator  , Transverse flux; TFPM; Ocean wave energy; Low Speed; Generator; Finite elements        ,"Modern energy demands led the scientific community to renewable energy sources, such as ocean wave energy. The present work describes a model for a cost efficient rotary electrical generator, optimized for ocean wave energy conversion. The electrical power, supplied by low speed mechanical movement, requires the use of electrical machinery capable of generating high amounts of torque. Among the analyzed topologies, the one selected for further study was the Transverse Flux Permanent Magnet machine (TFPM). This topology differs from the conventional ones, presenting high power and torque densities, and allowing to independently set machine current and magnetic loadings in the machine. The machine was designed and analyzed through the use of a 3D FEM software. The obtained results show that the TFPM is a strong candidate to be used in large scale converting systems."
Medical , Low Testosterone  , Testosterone; Cardiovascular Diseases; Erectile Dysfunction; Hypogonadism; Testosterone Deficiency; Metabolic Syndrome X; Abdominal Obesity; Diabetes Mellitus; Hypertension; Hypercholesterolemia        ,"Introduction Testosterone deficiency syndrome (TDS) is usually suspected on the basis of signs/symptoms. However, some men with low testosterone levels (low T) are asymptomatic or present mild, unnoticed symptoms. Would they have the same cardiovascular risk as symptomatic men? Aims This study aims to assess the relationship between presence/severity of low T-related symptoms and the likelihood of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Methods Data were taken from a multicenter, cross-sectional study conducted in Spain among men visiting men's healthcare offices aged 45 with low T (total T <8nmol/L or <12nmol/L and calculated free T <250nmol/L). Only subjects whose MetS components and symptoms had been assessed were selected. Data available included anthropometrics, toxic habits, comorbidities, and total testosterone (TT) levels. Main Outcome Measures MetS was defined using the harmonized definition. Erectile dysfunction was classified using the International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire. The Ageing Male Symptoms (AMS) scale assessed symptoms. Symptom severity was classified as none/mild and moderate/severe. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to calculate the effect of moderate/severe symptoms on the odds ratio (OR) for MetS. Results Mean age (SD) was 61.2 (8.1) years. Erectile dysfunction (ED), AMS, and MetS prevalence were 97.4%, 94.9%, and 69.6%. Prevalence of MetS was higher in men with moderate/severe symptoms vs. men with no/mild ones (75.3% vs. 57.9%, P<0.001). Age and prevalence of TT <8nmol/L, moderate/severe ED, and obesity were significantly higher in men with moderate/severe symptoms. Multivariate analysis showed that besides obesity and moderate/severe ED, moderate/severe symptoms increased the likelihood of MetS. This effect disappeared in men with severe ED and in the nonobese. Three symptoms showed relationship with MetS after adjusting for all confounding factors. Conclusion Severity of TDS symptoms may indicate higher cardiovascular risk in men with low T.

Civil , Remote Sensing  , Moon; water; hydroxyl; infrared spectroscopy; remote sensing        ,"Water and/or hydroxyl detected remotely on the lunar surface originates from several sources: (i) comets and other exogenous debris; (ii) solar-wind implantation; (iii) the lunar interior. While each of these sources is interesting in its own right, distinguishing among them is critical for testing hypotheses for the origin and evolution of the Moon and our Solar System. Existing spacecraft observations are not of high enough spectral resolution to uniquely characterize the bonding energies of the hydroxyl molecules that have been detected. Nevertheless, the spatial distribution and associations of H, OH-or H2O with specific lunar lithologies provide some insight into the origin of lunar hydrous materials. The global distribution of OH-/H2O as detected using infrared spectroscopic measurements from orbit is here examined, with particular focus on regional geological features that exhibit OH-/H2O absorption band strengths that differ from their immediate surroundings. This article is part of the themed issue 'The origin, history and role of water in the evolution of the inner Solar System'."
Medical , Skin Care  , Collagen Peptides; Carboxymethyl Chitosan; Microspheres; Irradiation Resistance; Histological Analysis        ,"Type I collagen peptides were prepared by hydrolysis of type I collagen protein with different enzyme combinations and this study found that the peptides obtained by papain/pepsin/trypsin combination hydrolysis were of the strongest anti-X-ray capability. The collagen peptides-carboxymethyl chitosan (CP-CMC-CaCl2) microspheres were prepared by emulsification method and used to investigate the effects on mice skin damages in vitro and in vivo. In vitro experiments indicated that the CP-CMC-CaCl2 microspheres had a protective effect on the X-ray irradiated damages of mice thymus lymphocytes. The mice skin surface texture morphological and histomorphological analysis showed a consistent result that the CP-CMC-CaCl2 microspheres played a certain role in the prevention of UV-B irradiated skin damages and could also improve ultraviolet prevention ability. Besides., the preventive function was better than its repair function. It is possible to improve the preventive function to skin photoaging and play a better effectiveness of cosmetic skin care by adding the CP-CMC-CaCl2 microspheres into make-up cosmetics as a natural antioxidant resource."
MAE , Hydraulics  , Hydropower station system; Coupled hydraulic-mechanical-electric model; Dynamic characteristics analysis        ,"A nonlinear dynamic coupled model for hydropower station system, which contains the model of water-carriage system, water turbine system, speed governor system, generator's electromagnetic system, grid, shaft system of hydroelectric generating set, as well as the powerhouse, is established in this paper. Firstly, the simultaneous differential equations for coupled hydraulic-mechanical-electric transient process are set up based upon the theories of hydraulics, electrical machinery, etc., while the coupled structural models for shaft system of unit and powerhouse are built by means of finite element method. Secondly, a new method for investigating nonlinear dynamic properties of structures influenced by coupled hydraulic-mechanical-electric factors in different conditions is introduced with the help of user-programmable features from Ansys software. Finally, in order to verify the rationality, several numerical calculation methods are used to study the starting-up process of hydropower station. The results indicate that the model presented in this paper is adoptable for simulating specified condition and reflect the nonlinear dynamic characteristics of hydropower station comprehensively. In addition, the model can also be used to assess the operation safety and predict the structures reliability of hydropower station system, so as to provide some profitable reference for dynamic regulation during limited and transient conditions for hydropower station."
Psychology  , Attention  , ADHD; DRD4; DAT1; VNTR        ,"The dopamine receptor-D4 and the dopamine transporter have been investigated for their role in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. Reports of their genetic association with ADHD have shown mixed results. The aim of the study was to evaluate the association of variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) of the DRD4 and DAT1 genes with ADHD in children. A pilot 1:1 case control study, with 44 clinically confirmed ADHD cases and 44 age/gender matched healthy controls, was conducted at a tertiary care centre in Mumbai. Variable number tandem repeats of DRD4 exon 3, DAT1 intron 8 and 3'UTR were genotyped by PCR-AGE. Several allele repeats of the genes were observed in the screened subjects. Statistical significance was observed for the 10R/10R genotype of the DAT1 3'UTR VNTR between cases and controls."
Medical , Sports Injuries  , Sports injury; Athletes; Postural stability        ,"[Purpose] The aim of this study was to analyze stabilometry in athletes during an indoor season in order to determine whether injured athletes show different stabilometric values before injury than non-injured athletes in two different training periods (volume and pre-competition periods). [Subjects] The subjects were 51 athletes from Unicaja athletic club who trained regularly. [Methods] At the end of the preseason and volume periods, athletes were subjected to bipodal and monopodal stabilometry. In addition, all injuries happening in the periods after performing stabilometry (volume and pre-competition periods) were tracked. [Results] Variance analysis of bipodal stabilometric measurements taken at the end of the preseason period showed that athletes with higher values for the center-of-pressure spread variables suffered injuries during the volume period. The right-leg monopodal stabilometric measurements taken at the end of the volume period showed that athletes with higher values in the center-of-pressure position variables suffered injuries during the pre-competition period. [Conclusion] Athletes showing the worst values for center-of-pressure spread variables are more prone to sports injuries in the subsequent training period. In monopodal measurements, athletes with poorer mediolateral stability were more prone to injuries in the subsequent training period."

In addition, clinical data of cerebrovascular accident patients were also analyzed by the same method. [Subjects] Ten healthy adult volunteers and two male patients with previous cerebrovascular accidents participated. [Methods] The subjects were tasked with reaching for objects shown on a display. The target and virtual limb, rendered with computer graphics, were shown on the display. Movements of the virtual limb were synchronized with those of the subject. Healthy subjects reached for targets with their dominant arm, and cerebrovascular accident patients used their paretic arm. A polarized display and polarized glasses were used when the subjects were shown three-dimensional images. In the present study, jerk cost was used to quantify the smoothness of movement. [Results] Six of the 10 healthy subjects had significantly smoother reaching movements when viewing the three-dimensional images. The two cerebrovascular accident patients tended to have smoother movements in response to the three-dimensional images. [Conclusion] Analysis of the smoothness of movement was able to detect the influence of the depth cue in vision on movement quantitatively for the healthy subjects and cerebrovascular accident patients."
ECE , Digital control  , active power filter; vector resonant controller; digital design        ,"\There are many factors that affect the performance of active power filter, which is a key factor for command current tracking control. Aiming at the deficiency of traditional PR controller, this paper puts forward an improved PR controller-vector resonant controller. The controller has the advantages of stronger anti-interference ability and greater gain at the resonance point, and it can improve the accuracy of harmonic compensation in the current compensation control. In this paper, the digital controller in the digital control system has been given a detailed design. Finally, the experimental results show that the control strategy can further reduce the harmonic content and improve the compensation accuracy."
biochemistry , Human Metabolism  , ALUMINUM; GALLIUM; INJECTION; RETENTION; EXCRETION        ,"1 Al-26 and Ga-67 were given as citrates to a healthy male volunteer by intravenous injection. The retention of both tracers was studied by body radioactivity measurement. Levels in blood and excreta were determined by gamma-ray spectrometry and/or accelerator mass spectrometry. 2 More than half of the Al-26 had left the blood after 15 min and the decline continued, leaving <1% in blood after 2 d; the losses occurred both to renal excretion and through uptake by other compartments. Estimated excretion up to 13 d was 83% (urine) and 1.8% (faeces). Whole-body retention of 15% at 13 d declined to similar to 4% at 1178 d, when the daily reduction corresponded to a biological half-life of 7 y, suggesting that sustained intake of dietary aluminium may lead to a progressively increasing internal deposit. 3 The metabolism of Ga-67 differed markedly from that of Al-26 in all aspects studied."
biochemistry , Polymerase chain reaction  , 1; 2-dicloropropane; dichloromethane; gpt delta rat; in vivo mutagenicity; liver        ,"1,2-Dichloropropane (1,2-DCP) and dichloromethane (DCM) are possible causative agents associated with the development of cholangiocarcinoma in employees working in printing plant in Osaka, Japan. However, few reports have demonstrated an association between these agents and cholangiocarcinoma in rodent carcinogenicity studies. Moreover, the combined effects of these compounds have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we evaluated the in vivo mutagenicity of 1,2-DCP and DCM, alone or combined, in the livers of gpt delta rats. Six-week-old male F344 gpt delta rats were treated with 1,2-DCP, DCM or 1,2-DCP+DCM by oral administration for 4weeks at the dose (200mgkg(-1) body weight 1,2-DCP and 500mgkg(-1) body weight DCM) used in the carcinogenesis study performed by the National Toxicology Program. In vivo mutagenicity was analyzed by gpt mutation/Spi(-) assays in the livers of rats. In addition, gene and protein expression of CYP2E1 and GSTT1, the major enzymes responsible for the genotoxic effects of 1,2-DCP and DCM, were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Gpt and Spi(-) mutation frequencies were not increased by 1,2-DCP and/or DCM in any group. Additionally, there were no significant changes in the gene and protein expression of CYP2E1 and GSTT1 in any group. These results indicated that 1,2-DCP, DCM and 1,2-DCP+DCM had no significant impact on mutagenicity in the livers of gpt delta rats under our experimental conditions.

Given the high selectivity of this compound at the cannabinoid CB2 receptor and the well-known protective function of this receptor in neurological disorders with autoimmune component like multiple sclerosis, we assessed the immunomodulatory properties of VL15. We assessed on activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells), proliferation and viability, cell cycle progression and measured activation markers and the expression of phosphorylated proteins. We found that VL15 reduces PBMC proliferation slightly affecting cell vitality, blocks the cell cycle progression and down-regulates the levels of T cell activation markers as well as the expression of phosphorylated proteins, NF-kB, IKK alpha beta, IKB alpha, ERK and Akt. VL15 was also used in drug permeability assays on Caco-2 cell line to evaluate its oral bioavailability and on MDCKII-hMDR1 cell lines to estimate its propensity to cross the blood-brain barrier by passive diffusion, in order to potentially maintain its efficiency on the infiltrating auto-reactive lymphocytes in the central nervous system. In these models, VL15 showed high intestinal absorption and good blood-brain barrier penetration. Our findings suggest that VL15, by controlling the immune response, might find potential application as orally administered drug in pathologies like multiple sclerosis.

biochemistry , Human Metabolism  , Chimeric mouse; liver; (uPA plus / plus )/SCID; human hepatocyte; metabolism        ,"1. A model that predicts human metabolism and disposition of drug candidates would be of value in early drug development. 2. In this study, a chimeric (uPA+/+)/SCID mouse model was evaluated with three structurally distinct compounds (GW695634, a benzophenone, SB-406725, a tetrahydroisoquinoline and GW823093, a fluoropyrrolidine) for which human metabolism and disposition was characterized. Human metabolite profiles in plasma and/or urine were compared to those of chimeric (uPA+/+)/SCID and control CD-1 or (uPA+/+)/SCID) mice. GW695634 and SB-406725 exhibited primarily hepatic metabolism and were chosen as probes to assess which human metabolites would likely circulate systemically. GW823093 exhibited a combination of hepatic and extrahepatic metabolism such that renal excretion of drug-related material was similar to 2-fold greater in humans than in mice, and thus chosen as a probe to assess if the chimeric (uPA+/+)/SCID mouse would predict the urinary excretion of human metabolites. 3. We observed that human metabolism and disposition was well represented for GW695634, somewhat represented for GW823093 and minimally represented for SB-406725. Collectively, the results of this and other studies suggest that while limitations for prediction of human metabolism and disposition exist, humanized chimeric mouse models can potentially represent informative new tools in drug discovery and development."
biochemistry , Human Metabolism  , Chimeric mouse; chymase inhibitor; clinical study; cytochrome P450; SCID mouse; UDP-glucuronosyltransferase        ,"1. A novel oral chymase inhibitor, SUN13834, is under clinical development for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). In this study, in vitro and in vivo metabolic profiles of SUN13834 were compared between severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, chimeric mice with humanized liver and humans. 2. In in vitro experiments using liver microsomes, predominant metabolites of SUN13834 were glucuronide (MG-1) in SCID mice and hydroxylated metabolite (M-3) in chimeric mice and humans. 3. After a single oral dose of [C-14]SUN13834 to SCID and chimeric mice, glucuronidation was the major metabolic pathway in SCID mice, while the parent compound, ring opening form (M-5), O-demethylated form of M-5 (M-6) and glucuronidation of M-6 (M-6G) were detected at higher levels in chimeric mice compared to SCID mice. 4. When AD patients were orally treated using SUN13834 for 28 days, the parent compound had the highest concentration in plasma, and M-6, M-6G, M-5 and MG-1 were identified as major metabolites. 5. This is the first report of SUN13834 metabolic information in human. In addition, based on similarities in metabolic profiles between chimeric mice and humans, it was concluded that chimeric mice are useful for predicting SUN13834 metabolism in humans during early stages of drug development."
Psychology  , Prenatal development  , female alternative morphotype; female masculinization; maternal effects; reproductive traits; social context        ,"1. Alternative morphotypes have been reported less frequently in females than in males. An exception to this rule is the gradient of phenotypical masculinization reported in some female mammals, in which feminized and masculinized females represent two opposite ends along this gradient. These phenotypical differences originate during prenatal development as the consequence of maternal effects. Feminized and masculinized females differ in several traits, including morphological, physiological, behavioural and reproductive traits. 2. Differences previously reported in reproductive traits between feminized and masculinized females come mostly from mechanistic studies performed in the laboratory, and not necessarily on social species. As a result, it is unclear to what extent these reported differences between female alternative morphotypes materialize in wild, natural populations. 3. We quantified the effect of female alternative morphotype on female reproductive traits in a natural population of Octodon degus, a highly social rodent. We assessed female alternative morphotype through a continuous gradient of anogenital distance. Thus, feminized females were close to the short end of anogenital distance, while masculinized females were close to the long end of this gradient. We also tested the hypothesis that the social environment interacts with female morphotype to influence female reproductive traits. 4. In female degus, only body weight affected litter size, where heavier females weaned more offspring. Masculinized females delivered male-biased litters and weaned heavier offspring. Lastly, masculinized females gave birth later in the breeding season compared to feminized females. 5. Contrary to previous claims, our findings do not support that masculinized females are less fertile than feminized females. Moreover, masculinized females produced heavier, potentially higher quality offspring compared with feminized females."
biochemistry , Northern blotting  , angiotensin II; losartan; renovascular hypertension; tissue-specific inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2        ,"1. Angiotensin (Ang) II plays a major role in vascular remodelling. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) are involved in the tissue remodelling processes. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether AngII modulates TIMP-2 expression in rat aortic smooth muscle cells in vivo. 2. Angiotensin II (200 ng/kg per min, s.c.) or AngII + losartan (10 mg/kg per day, s.c.) or normal saline was administered continuously by osmotic minipumps to Sprague-Dawley rats for 1 week. In addition, the effect of endogenous AngII on TIMP-2 expression was evaluated in renovascular hypertensive rats (two kidney, one clip (2K1C) and one kidney, one clip (1K1C) models). Control rats (sham 2K1C and sham 1K1C rats) underwent sham-clipping of the left renal artery. At the end of the treatment, plasma renin activity was measured by radioimmunoassay, aortic TIMP-2 mRNA expression was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction and/or northern blotting and protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured twice a week by the tail-cuff method. 3. Exogenous AngII administration produced the expected increase in SBP (P = 0.02) compared with the control saline-treated group. The increase in SBP was abolished in AngII + losartan-treated rats. Administration of AngII caused a significant increase in TIMP-2 expression (P = 0.01) in rat aortic smooth muscle cells that was abolished in AngII + losartan-treated rats. In renovascular hypertensive rats, SBP was higher (P < 0.0001) in 2K1C and 1K1C rats compared with the corresponding sham-operated rats. Plasma renin activity was higher (P < 0.01) in 2K1C rats compared with the other groups. The expression of TIMP-2 was significantly (P < 0.05) increased only in 2K1C rats. 4. Our in vivo data demonstrate that exogenous and endogenous AngII increases TIMP-2 expression in rat aortic smooth muscle cells. This effect is not dependent on the AngII-induced increase in blood pressure and is mediated by angiotensin AT(1) receptors."
CS , Operating systems  , biodiversity surveys; camera trapping; data management; detection history; monitoring; occupancy models; photo trapping; spatial capture-recapture models; wildlife studies        ,"1. Camera trapping is a widely applied method to study mammalian biodiversity and is still gaining popularity. It can quickly generate large amounts of data which need to be managed in an efficient and transparent way that links data acquisition with analytical tools. 2. We describe the free and open-source R package camtrapR, a new toolbox for flexible and efficient management of data generated in camera trap-based wildlife studies. The package implements a complete workflow for processing camera trapping data. It assists in image organization, species and individual identification, data extraction from images, tabulation and visualization of results and export of data for subsequent analyses. There is no limitation to the number of images stored in this data management system; the system is portable and compatible across operating systems. 3. The functions provide extensive automation to minimize data entry mistakes and, apart from species and individual identification, require minimal manual user input. Species and individual identification are performed outside the R environment, either via tags assigned in dedicated image management software or by moving images into species directories. 4. Input for occupancy and (spatial) capture-recapture analyses for density and abundance estimation, for example in the R packages unmarked or secr, is computed in a flexible and reproducible manner. In addition, survey summary reports can be generated, spatial distributions of records can be plotted and exported to GIS software, and single-and two-species activity patterns can be visualized. 5. camtrapR allows for streamlined and flexible camera trap data management and should be most useful to researchers and practitioners who regularly handle large amounts of camera trapping data."
ECE , Microcontroller  , applied ecology; disease ecology; incubator; microbial ecology; replication; thermal biology        ,"1. Commercially available fluctuating-temperature chambers are large and costly. This poses a challenge to experimental ecologists endeavouring to recreate natural temperature cycles in the laboratory because the large number of commercial chambers required for replicated study designs is prohibitively expensive to purchase, requires a large amount of space and consumes a great deal of energy. 2. We developed and validated a design for economical, programmable fluctuating-temperature chambers based on a relatively small (23 L) commercially manufactured constant temperature chamber ($140US) modified with a customized, user-friendly microcontroller ($15US). 3. Over a 1-week trial, these chambers reliably reproduced a real-world fluctuating (13.1-35.5 degrees C) body temperature regime of an individual frog, with a near-perfect 1 : 1 fit between target and actual temperatures (y = 1.0036x + 0.1366, R-2 = 0.9977, 95% confidence interval for slope = 1.0026, 1.0046). Over 30-day trials, they also reliably produced a simpler daily fluctuating-temperature scheme (sine wave fluctuating between 10 and 25 degrees C each 24 h) and a range of constant temperature regimes. 4. The design is inexpensive and simple to assemble in large numbers, enabling genuine replication of even highly complex, many treatment study designs. For example, it is possible to simultaneously examine in replicate chambers the responses of organisms to constant regimes, regimes that fluctuate following the means experienced by populations and regimes that exactly mimic fluctuations measured over any length of time for particular individuals that differ in behaviour or microhabitat use. These chambers thus vastly expand the pool of resources available for manipulative experiments in thermal biology and ecology."
biochemistry , Enzymology  , Cyadox; pigs; cyadox monoxide; N-oxides; N-oxide reduction; non-enzymatic reduction        ,"1. Cyadox is a novel quinoxaline-1,4-dioxide with the potential for development as a substitute for the banned veterinary drugs carbadox and olaquindox. In this paper, using pigs as the test subjects, the metabolic mechanism of cyadox N-oxide reduction in liver is demonstrated. 2. There exist two metabolic mechanisms for the N-oxide reduction of cyadox, the enzymatic and non-enzymatic routes. It is found that cyadox can be enzymatically reduced to 4-cyadox monoxide and 1-cyadox monoxide; this process is catalyzed by aldehyde oxidase and xanthine oxidase in the cytosol and by cytochrome b5 reductase in the microsomes. On the other hand, cyadox is only reduced to 4-cyadox monoxide in the non-enzymatic reduction mediated by heme groups of catalase and cytochrome P450s. 3. We supposed that, owing to the position of the side chain in cyadox, the 1-N-oxide and 4-N-oxide bonds in the quinoxaline ring had different biochemical activities, which caused cyadox to be shunted to the distinct metabolic mechanisms. Additionally, this research gives the first evidence of FAD- and NAD(P)H-dependent non-enzymatic catalase reduction of a heterocyclic N-oxide. The research provides a basic foundation for the formulation of safety controls for animal products and the properties and metabolism of heterocyclic N-oxides."
Psychology  , Attention  , Daphnetin; COMT inhibitor; 8-O-methyldaphnetin; ligand-protein interaction; Phase II metabolite; structural modification        ,"1. Finding and developing inhibitors of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) from natural products is highly recommended. Daphnetin, a naturally occurring catechol from the family thymelaeaceae, has a chemical structure similar to several potent COMT inhibitors reported previously. Here the potential of daphnetin and its Phase II metabolites as inhibitors of COMT was investigated with human liver cytosol (HLC). 2. Daphnetin and its methylated metabolite (8-O-methyldaphnetin) were found to inhibit COMT-mediated dopamine O-methylation in a dose-dependent manner. The IC50 values for daphnetin (0.51 similar to 0.53 mu M) and 8-O-methyldaphnetin (22.5 similar to 24.3 mu M) were little affected by changes in HLC concentrations. Further kinetic analysis showed the differences in inhibition type and parameters (K-i) between daphnetin (competitive, 0.37 mu M) and 8-O-methyldaphnetin (noncompetitive, 25.7 mu M). Other metabolites, including glucuronidated and sulfated species, showed negligible inhibition against COMT. By using in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IV-IVE), a 24.3-fold increase in the exposure of the COMT substrates was predicted when they are co-administrated with daphnetin. 3. With high COMT-inhibiting activity, daphnetin could serve as a lead compound for the design and development of new COMT inhibitors. Also, much attention should be paid to the clinical impact of combination of daphnetin and herbal preparations containing daphnetin with the drugs primarily cleared by COMT."
biochemistry , Immunology  , Asecodes; cellular defence; ecological immunology; Galerucella; host-parasitoid interactions; host-pathogen evolution        ,"1. Host-parasitoid systems are characterized by a continuous development of new defence strategies in hosts and counter-defence mechanisms in parasitoids. This co-evolutionary arms race makes host-parasitoid systems excellent for understanding trade-offs in host use caused by evolutionary changes in host immune responses and parasitoid virulence. However, knowledge obtained from natural host-parasitoid systems on such trade-offs is still limited. 2. In this study, the aim was to examine trade-offs in parasitoid virulence in Asecodes parviclava (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) when attacking three closely related beetles: Galerucella pusilla, Galerucella calmariensis and Galerucella tenella (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). A second aim was to examine whether geographic variation in parasitoid infectivity or host immune response could explain differences in parasitism rate between northern and southern sites. 3. More specifically, we wanted to examine whether the capacity to infect host larvae differed depending on the previous host species of the parasitoids and if such differences were connected to differences in the induction of host immune systems. This was achieved by combining controlled parasitism experiments with cytological studies of infected larvae. 4. Our results reveal that parasitism success in A. parviclava differs both depending on previous and current host species, with a higher virulence when attacking larvae of the same species as the previous host. Virulence was in general high for parasitoids from G. pusilla and low for parasitoids from G. calmariensis. At the same time, G. pusilla larvae had the strongest immune response and G. calmariensis the weakest. These observations were linked to changes in the larval hemocyte composition, showing changes in cell types important for the encapsulation process in individuals infected by more or less virulent parasitoids. 5. These findings suggest ongoing evolution in parasitoid virulence and host immune response, making the system a strong candidate for further studies on host race formation and speciation."
ECE , Satellite radio  , animal movement; area-restricted search; Argos satellite tracking; first-passage time analysis; GPS tracking; habitat-use quantification; spatial scale        ,"1. How and at what spatial scale(s) animals change their movements in relation to their environment is central to several topics in ecology and conservation, including foraging ecology, habitat selection and dispersal. A method (first-passage time analysis, FPT) has recently been proposed to measure changes in movements through the landscape, as an index of search effort at the pertinent spatial scales. This method seems largely applicable to an increasing number of studies using satellite, radio-tracking or global positioning system (GPS), but its limits have not yet been assessed. 2. Here I used several movement simulations to examine the ability of FPT analysis to detect area-restricted search (ARS) according to different changes in movements, different patch structures and tracking accuracy. 3. FPT analysis was able to detect changes in movements when both speed and sinuosity changed, or when the animal reacted to patch boundaries. It was also able to detect ARS within the same path at several spatial scales in patches (nested or not) of different sizes. 4. Tracking accuracy affected the detection of ARS by FPT analysis. With the widely used Argos system, a minimum of 13 locations in effective ARS was necessary to detect this behaviour; seven when velocity filtering was applied. Similarly, spatial error in location affected the estimation of the ARS scale value, but the application of velocity filtering reduced this effect. 5. Comparisons between a real GPS track and pathways simulating the Argos error showed that the time-sampling rate of locations (due to satellite-pass frequency) decreased the probability of detecting ARS at small scales (50% across the whole range of scales. A velocity filter enabled significant reductions in this effect. 6. Synthesis and application. Within limits, FPT analysis is highly suitable for animal movement analysis, either to quantify habitat use, or to determine the scale most relevant for describing an ecological system or factors affecting movement decisions. In anticipation of increasing applications of FPT analysis in applied ecology, I provide recommendations for the use of the technique with several tracking methods."
biochemistry , Northern blotting  , ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter; cloning; digoxin intoxication; mouse; mRNA        ,"1. Human ABCA8, a new member of the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, transports certain lipophilic drugs, such as digoxin. To investigate the roles of this transporter, we cloned a mouse homologue of ABCA8, from a mouse heart cDNA library, named ABCA8a. 2. The deduced mouse ABCA8a protein is 66% identical with that of human ABCA8 and possesses features common to the ABC superfamily. It was found that ABCA8a was mainly expressed in the liver and heart, similar to human ABCA8. 3. We further evaluated the effect of acute digoxin (a substrate for ABCA8) intoxication on the mRNA expression of ABCA8 using northern blotting with a 3' non-coding region as a probe to avoid cross-hybridization with other ABCA genes. 4. Following acute digoxin infusion, the mRNA expression of ABCA8 was significantly reduced in the liver 12-24 h after injection (14.7% of vehicle treatment), but not in the heart and kidney. 5. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed the reduction in ABCA8a mRNA. Similar reductions in ABCA5, ABCA7, ABCA8b and ABCA9 mRNA were also observed. A comparable amount of digitoxin did not affect ABCA8a mRNA expression in the liver. 6. The results suggest that ABCA8 may play a role in digoxin metabolism in the liver."
biochemistry , Human Metabolism  , Aldehyde oxidase; cytochrome P450; human liver; human-chimeric mice; mouse liver; rat-chimeric mice; zaleplon        ,"1. Human chimeric mice (h-PXB mice) having humanized liver, constructed by transplantation of human hepatocytes, were evaluated as an experimental model for predicting human drug metabolism. Metabolism of zaleplon in h-PXB mice was compared with that in rat chimeric mice (r-PXB mice) constructed by transplantation of rat hepatocytes. 2. Zaleplon is metabolized to 5-oxo-zaleplon by aldehyde oxidase and to desethyl-zaleplon by cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4) in rat and human liver preparations. 3. Liver S9 fraction of h-PXB mice metabolized zaleplon to 5-oxo-zaleplon and desethylzaleplon in similar amounts. However, liver S9 fractions of r-PXB and control (urokinase-type plasminogen activator-transgenic severe combined immunodeficient) mice predominantly metabolized zaleplon to desethyl-zaleplon. 5-Oxo-zaleplon was detected as a minor metabolite. 4. Oxidase activity of h-PXB mouse liver cytosol toward zaleplon was about 10-fold higher than that of r-PXB or control mice. In contrast, activities for desethyl-zaleplon formation were similar in liver microsomes from these mice, as well as rat and human liver microsomes. 5. In vivo, the level of 5-oxo-zaleplon in plasma of h-PXB mice was about 7-fold higher than that in r-PXB or control mice, in agreement with the in vitro data. Thus, aldehyde oxidase in h-PXB mice functions as human aldehyde oxidase, both in vivo and in vitro. 6. In contrast, the plasma level of desethyl-zaleplon in r-PXB and control mice was higher than that in h-PXB mice. 7. These results suggest h-PXB mice with humanized liver could be a useful experimental model to predict aldehyde oxidase-and CYP3A4-mediated drug metabolism in humans."
biochemistry , Human Metabolism  , Drug metabolism; human-chimeric mice; human liver; mouse liver; phase I enzymes; phase II enzymes; rat-chimeric mice        ,"1. Human-chimeric mice with humanized liver have been constructed by transplantation of human hepatocytes into several types of mice having genetic modifications that injure endogenous liver cells. Here, we focus on liver urokinase-type plasminogen activator-transgenic severe combined immunodeficiency (uPA/SCID) mice, which are the most widely used human-chimeric mice. Studies so far indicate that drug metabolism, drug transport, pharmacological effects and toxicological action in these mice are broadly similar to those in humans. 2. Expression of various drug-metabolizing enzymes is known to be different between humans and rodents. However, the expression pattern of cytochrome P450, aldehyde oxidase and phase II enzymes in the liver of human-chimeric mice resembles that in humans, not that in the host mice. 3. Metabolism of various drugs, including S-warfarin, zaleplon, ibuprofen, naproxen, coumarin, troglitazone and midazolam, in human-chimeric mice is mediated by human drug-metabolizing enzymes, not by host mouse enzymes, and thus resembles that in humans. 4. Pharmacological and toxicological effects of various drugs in human-chimeric mice are also similar to those in humans. 5. The current consensus is that chimeric mice with humanized liver are useful to predict drug metabolism catalyzed by cytochrome P450, aldehyde oxidase and phase II enzymes in humans in vivo and in vitro. Some remaining issues are discussed in this review."
biochemistry , Genetics  , carbon; ecosystem function; ecosystem structure; genotypic diversity; genotypic variation; grassland; intraspecific diversity; soil nutrients; water        ,"1. Individual plant genotypes as well as genotypic diversity can shape the structure and function of ecosystems; however, the abiotic environment may modify these genotypic influences on ecosystem-level responses. 2. To explore how the interactions between plant genotype, genotypic diversity and soil nutrient availability affect the structure and function of a temperate grassland ecosystem, we manipulated the genotypic diversity of a common perennial herbaceous plant, Solidago altissima (single genotype monoculture and diversity plots) and soil nutrient availability (+nitrogen, +phosphorus, +nitrogen and +phosphorus, unmanipulated control) in a common garden setting. We tracked temporal changes in ecosystem structure (e.g. leaf area index and net primary productivity) as well as a variety of ecosystem functions (e.g. net ecosystem carbon and water exchange and soil carbon efflux) over a growing season. 3. We found that variation in plant genotype identity consistently shaped ecosystem structure (above-ground net primary productivity) while it inconsistently altered several ecosystem functions across time. For instance, variation in plant genotype identity influenced net ecosystem carbon dynamics early in the growing season while it influenced water dynamics later in the growing season. The strength of the relationship between genotypic diversity and ecosystem function declined over the season and the relationship between ecosystem structure (above-ground net primary productivity) and function (net ecosystem carbon and water exchange) varied across treatments. Overall, there was a strong correlation between ecosystem structure and function across monoculture genotype plots but a weak relationship between ecosystem structure and function across mixed genotype plots. Surprisingly, soil nutrients did not influence ecosystem structure and had minimal impacts on carbon and water flux. 4. Our data suggest that plant genetic variation, and to some extent plant genotypic diversity, strongly influence ecosystem structure and function in an old-field ecosystem, but nutrient availability did not directly or interactively influence ecosystem structure or function."
Civil , Green Building  , social innovation; schools of sustainability; Jevons Paradox; occupant behavior; ecological thinking in architecture        ,"1. INTRODUCTION Sustainability has been defined as the need to preserve existing natural resources so that the earth is able to continue to provide these resources for future generations. Put more simply, a sustainable system is one that survives or persists (Costanza and Patten, 1995). In order to ensure the sustainability of architectural and building activity, it is essential that work in this field is conducted in accordance with the canons of basic ecology and, in addition, that its members seek to address certain cultural and relational characteristics that typify the way we live today. Architecture as a discipline combines technology and art; however, with the advent of ""sustainable architecture"" additional concepts from the fields of ecology, sociology, and philosophy have been incorporated. Yet, the fundamental problem is that the meanings of both the classical and the new concepts remain ambiguous, their significance shifting with our cultural evolution. Hence, the traditional Vitruvian values of architecture (beauty, structure and utility) are no longer so obvious, especially when we are required to think in terms of sustainability. Although the question as to why architecture matters has been answered in a variety of ways (Glaeser, 2011), it is our contention that in the 21st century architecture will matter more than ever, because by 2050 most of the world's population will be concentrated in cities. As a result, the sustainability of dwellings and cities has acquired undeniable importance. Two interacting forces influence all populations. One is the Malthusian dynamic of exponential growth until environmental limits are reached (Figure 1). The second is the Darwinian dynamics of innovation and adaptation that circumvent these limits through biological or cultural evolution. Nekola et al., in 2013 reported that the specific manifestation of these two forces in our current society provide the context that establishes how humans may develop sustainable relationships within our finite planet (Figure 2). Consequently, a permanent and indefinite growth is impossible due to the physical and biological imperatives of our finite world. Biologists and architects and constructors usually inhabit different worlds. The latter innovate, deploy, and apply their techno-science based designs; the first, study the finite nature, propose hypotheses, and gather their evidence. And, to date, there is little to suggest that copying nature purports any advantages to architects, primarily because fully autonomous buildings or towns have yet to be built. According to the described Malthusian-Darwinian dynamic, the two critical questions that we seek to address in this paper are: i) What is the essence of a sustainable dwelling? and ii) What principles should be adhered to in making a dwelling sustainable? In other words, this study aims to elucidate the essence of sustainability in green building design implementation."
Civil , Green Building  , Sustainability; Energy Conservation; Passive Design; Building Use; Climate Zones        ,"1. INTRODUCTION The emergence of environmental problems as major social issues throughout the world has prompted sustainable development efforts in a wide range of areas, including industry, construction, and transportation, followed by the execution of numerous studies and policies. The concept of sustainable development has been dealt with in earnest in the construction field since the Declaration of Interdependence for a Sustainable Future at the 18th Chicago Convention of UIA in 1993. This Declaration included tasks to be implemented with respect to green buildings, such as the recycling of resources, application of energy-efficient designs, and utilization of natural energy in addition to the application of sustainable designs. As part of green building practices, countries around the world have been implementing various green building certification standards, such as LEED, GBCC, CASBEE, and BREEAM. These certification standards prescribe the criteria relating to the external environment, energy conservation, materials and resources, and the indoor environment, with energy conservation being the top priority for each of these issues. This is due to energy consumption in building operation accounting for more than half of the building life cycle cost. Accordingly, although many studies are undertaken for the purpose of developing the means for conserving energy in relation to green buildings, the majority of these studies are concentrated on the development of technologies for environmental facilities through the application of active designs. study the finite nature, propose hypotheses, and gather their evidence. And, to date, there is little to suggest that copying nature purports any advantages to architects, primarily because fully autonomous buildings or towns have yet to be built. According to the described Malthusian-Darwinian dynamic, the two critical questions that we seek to address in this paper are: i) What is the essence of a sustainable dwelling? and ii) What principles should be adhered to in making a dwelling sustainable?

Civil , Water Pollution  , marine; freshwater; Red List; springs; coral reef    pond; lagoon    conservation assessment      ,"1. Invertebrates inhabiting marine and freshwater ecosystems make important contributions to global biodiversity and provide significant services that have cascading effects across ecosystems. However, this group is grossly under-represented in assessments of conservation status and often neglected in targeted aquatic conservation efforts. 2. In global assessments of 7857 freshwater invertebrates and 2864 marine invertebrates, 30-34% were considered Data Deficient highlighting the paucity of information for making such assessments. Of the invertebrate groups that could be assessed, those with poor dispersal abilities and high local endemism, such as many gastropods, crayfish and mussels, are the most threatened. 3. Springs and subterranean hydrological systems support the highest proportions of threatened freshwater species, while in marine environments coral reefs, lagoons and anchialine systems are particularly vulnerable. 4. Key agents of biodiversity decline in aquatic ecosystems are water pollution, overexploitation and harvesting, habitat degradation and destruction, alien invasive species, and climate change. Effects of dams and water management along with pollution from urban, agricultural and forestry sources are the main threats in freshwater ecosystems, whereas a broad range of factors have impacts on marine invertebrates, including biological resource use. 5. Significant impediments facing conservation of aquatic invertebrates are limited knowledge of their diversity, the need for broadscale actions to account for connectivity within and across ecosystems, lack of political will and investment, and the prospect that conditions may get worse before they improve, possibly not in time to save some already highly imperilled invertebrate species from extinction.

MAE , Hydraulics  , elevated CO2; eucalyptus; genotype; leaf economics; leaf hydraulics; photosynthetic capacity; trait coordination        ,"1. Leaf economics and hydraulic traits strongly influence photosynthesis. While the level of coordination among these traits can differ between sets of species, leaf functional trait coordination within species remains poorly understood. Furthermore, elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2 commonly influence the expression of leaf photosynthetic, economics and hydraulic traits in contrasting ways, yet the effect of variable concentrations of atmospheric CO2 on patterns of trait coordination within species remains largely untested. 2. We examined the relationships among key leaf photosynthetic (e. g. net photosynthesis and photosynthetic biochemistry), economics and water-use (e. g. leaf mass per unit area and stomatal conductance) and hydraulic traits (e. g. vein density) in 14 genotypes of Eucalyptus camaldulensis grown in ambient (aCO(2)) and elevated (eCO(2)) [CO2]. We examined the level of coordination among leaf traits in aCO(2) and then assessed whether growth in eCO(2) altered that coordination. 3. We found that leaf traits related to photosynthetic capacity, economics and water-use, and hydraulics were decoupled among genotypes grown in aCO(2), yet strong relationships were generally observed among suites of traits within each 'functional group'. 4. Significant responses to growth in eCO(2) were observed for most leaf photosynthetic and economics and water-use traits, with the magnitude and direction of the response varying among traits. In contrast, leaf hydraulics traits were unaffected by variable growth CO2. Despite this, growth in eCO(2) did not substantially alter patterns of leaf trait coordination observed in aCO(2). 5. These results suggest suites of leaf traits associated with photosynthetic capacity, economics and water-use and hydraulics, respectively, can form independent axes of variation among genotypes of a single species, regardless of growth CO2. Although growth in eCO(2) did not substantially alter patterns of trait coordination, decoupling of leaf functional traits among genotypes may allow genetically distinct populations to produce novel combinations of traits that may be adaptive in response to changes in their local environment."
Medical , Hepatitis C  , CYP3A1; disposition; docetaxel; liver injury; magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate; P-gp        ,"1. Magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate (MgIg) has been extensively used in treating liver injury which is the common adverse reaction of docetaxel (DOC). Due to the narrow therapeutic window, small changes in pharmacokinetic profiles can alter the toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of DOC significantly. The study aimed to explore the effects of MgIg on the disposition of DOC and the potential mechanism in DOC-induced liver injury. 2. Pharmacokinetics and tissues distribution behaviors showed that there was no significant difference between DOC group (DOCG) and MgIg+DOC group (MDOCG). The mRNA and protein levels of cytochrome P450 3A1 (CYP3A1) in liver, intestine, and kidney were significantly upregulated, and the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was obviously downregulated in MDOCG when compared with DOCG. 3. Immunoglobulin M (IgM), CD8+ were upregulated in DOCG; while in MDOCG, IgM, CD8+ recovered to normal levels and complement C-3; CD4+ were upregulated. 4. MgIg had no significant effects on the disposition of DOC in docetaxel-induced liver injury. Additional, potential drug-drug interaction may happen if MgIg co-administered with antitumor drugs which are the substrates of CYP3A4 or P-gp. Hepatoprotective mechanism of MgIg perhaps was through upregulation of C-3, CD4+ and downregulation of IgM, CD8+."
biochemistry , Human Metabolism  , ABT-107; cytochrome P450; FMO; species difference        ,"1. Metabolism of ABT-107 was investigated in in vitro hepatic systems, in rat and monkey receiving [C-14] ABT-107, and in vivo plasma in rat, dog, monkey and human. 2. In in vitro hepatic systems, ABT-107 was primarily cleared via oxidative metabolism, and proceeded via two parallel pathways. Pathway 1, ABT-107 was oxidized at the nitrogen of quinuclidine moiety to form M1. Pathway 2, oxidation occurred at indole-containing moiety to form M2. Metabolism via N-oxidation was predominant in dog and rat, while in monkey and human, metabolism proceeded primarily via oxidation of indole-containing moiety. 3. ABT-107 was extensively metabolized in vivo in rat and monkey. M1 was primarily found in rat urine and bile; whereas, M2 was the major metabolite in monkey urine and feces. M1 was the predominant circulating metabolite in dog and rat. M2 was the primary circulating metabolite in monkey and human. 4. Enzymatic studies suggested M1 formation was primarily mediated by renal FMO1. CYP3A4, 1A2, 2J2 and 2D6 were primary enzymes catalyzing M2 formation. 5. Biotransformation of ABT-107 in human and monkey is markedly different from that in dog and rat, suggesting that monkey is an appropriate model for predicting human biotransformation and toxicology of ABT-107."
biochemistry , Molecular biology  , Disposition; homoharringtonine; mepesuccinate; metabolism; metabolites; metabolite profiling; omacetaxine; pharmacokinetics        ,"1. Omacetaxine mepesuccinate (hereafter referred to as omacetaxine) is a protein translation inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for adult patients with chronic myeloid leukemia with resistance and/or intolerance to two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors. 2. The objective was to investigate the metabolite profile of omacetaxine in plasma, urine and faeces samples collected up to 72h after a single 1.25-mg/m(2) subcutaneous dose of C-14-omacetaxine in cancer patients. 3. High-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (MS) (high resolution) in combination with off-line radioactivity detection was used for metabolite identification. 4. In total, six metabolites of omacetaxine were detected. The reactions represented were mepesuccinate ester hydrolysis, methyl ester hydrolysis, pyrocatechol conversion from the 1,3-dioxole ring. Unchanged omacetaxine was the most prominent omacetaxine-related compound in plasma. In urine, unchanged omacetaxine was also dominant, together with 4'-DMHHT. In feces very little unchanged omacetaxine was found and the pyrocatechol metabolite of omacetaxine, M534 and 4'-desmethyl homoharringtonine (4'-DMHHT) was the most abundant metabolites. 5. Omacetaxine was extensively metabolized, with subsequent renal and hepatic elimination of the metabolites. The low levels of the metabolites found in plasma indicate that the metabolites are unlikely to contribute materially to the efficacy and/or toxicity of omacetaxine."
Medical , Weight Loss  , Diapause; hymenoptera; multiple stresses; pollinator health; trypanosome; virulence        ,"1. Seasonal adaptations enabling the bridging of periodic challenging abiotic conditions are taxonomically widespread. However, sensitivity to other environmental stresses can be heightened during these periods. 2. Several temperate insects with over-wintering strategies play key ecosystem and economic roles, including wild bee pollinators. For example, hibernation survival in temperate bumblebees is crucial, as only new queens of future social colonies over-winter. These bees are also faced with other abiotic and biotic stressors, some of which have been linked to recent pollinator declines, such as exposure to pesticides and parasites. 3. Using a fully crossed experiment, the influence of dietary exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides (thiamethoxam and clothianidin) and/or the prevalent bumblebee parasite Crithidia bombi on hibernation survival and hibernation weight change of Bombus terrestris bumblebee queens was investigated. 4. Both neonicotinoid and C. bombi exposures reduced hibernation success individually, but no additive or synergistic effects between the stressors were found. Further, effects were asynchronous, with early neonicotinoid effects on hibernation mortality overriding later parasite effects under combined exposures. Neonicotinoid exposure also increased hibernation weight loss of surviving queens. 5. Diapause periods, employed by numerous temperate organisms, are likely to be especially vulnerable to environmental stresses, besides the seasonal challenge for which these periods are an adaptation. Thus, diapause requires inclusion during the consideration of the impacts of such stresses. Accordingly, it is demonstrated here that naturally relevant exposures of pesticides and parasites have important detrimental effects on bumblebees during a critical hibernation period, with potential consequences for populations of these key wild pollinators."
MAE , Strength of materials  , porous sound-absorbing material; curing technology; compression strength; volume weight        ,"A series of different volume-weights of Silicate-based porous sound-absorbing materials, which are cured by different methods or contain different contents of viscosity-controlling agent, have been manufactured by the Portland cement, with the way of in-situ assembly. The sound-absorbing characteristics are tested by the devices of standing wave, the compressive strength of materials is tested by WDW microcomputer servo tensile (compression) testing machine,. The result shows that, Average absorption coefficient of porous sound-absorbing materials is more than 0.7 from 800Hz to 6300Hz. As the increasing of volume-weights and viscosity-controlling agent contents, porous sound-absorbing materials' compressive strength separately increase and decrease. At the same time, different methods of cure and water-cement ratio have significantly effects on high volume-weight porous sound-absorbing materials' compressive strength."

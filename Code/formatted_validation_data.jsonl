While local voxelwise analyses showed associations between PiB and AV-1451 tracer largely in the temporal lobes, k-means clustering revealed that some of these associations were driven by regions with low tracer retention. We followed this up with a whole-brain region-by-region (local and non-local) partial correlational analysis. We calculated each participant's mean AV-1451 and PiB uptake values within 87 regions of interest (ROI). Pairwise ROI analysis demonstrated many positive PiB AV-1451 associations. Importantly, strong positive partial correlations (controlling for age, sex, and global gray matter fraction, p <.01) were identified between PiB in multiple regions of association cortex and AV-1451 in temporal cortical ROIs. There were also less frequent and weaker positive associations of regional PiB with frontoparietal AV-1451 uptake. Particularly in temporal lobe ROIs, AV-1451 uptake was strongly predicted by NB across multiple ROI locations.

The theoretical framework described in this paper generalises previous models and exposes several fundamental aspects of the physics of unsteady plumes. The framework allows one to understand how the structure of the governing integral equations depends on the assumptions one makes about the radial dependence of the longitudinal velocity, turbulence and pressure. Consequently, the ill-posed models identified by Scase & Hewitt (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 697, 2012, pp. 455-480) are shown to be the result of a non-physical assumption regarding the velocity profile. The framework reveals that these ill-posed unsteady plume models are degenerate cases amongst a comparatively large set of well-posed models that can be derived from the generalised unsteady plume equations that we obtain. Drawing on the results of DNS of a plume subjected to an instantaneous step change in its source buoyancy flux, we use the framework in a diagnostic capacity to investigate the properties of the resulting travelling wave. In general, the governing integral equations are hyperbolic, becoming parabolic in the limiting case of a 'top-hat' model, and the travelling wave can be classified as lazy, pure or forced according to the particular assumptions that are invoked to close the integral equations. Guided by observations from the DNS data, we use the framework in a prognostic capacity to develop a relatively simple, accurate and well-posed model of unsteady plumes that is based on the assumption of a Gaussian velocity profile.

Although several small molecules have been found to be capable of partially affecting FIXa function (i.e. ethylene glycol, Ca2+, and low molecular weight heparin [LMWH]), the resulting modest changes in peptidolytic activity have made the study of their mechanisms of action challenging. As these effects provide hints about potential regulatory forces that may be operational in the full expression of FIXa coagulant activity, their description remains of great interest. Studies of crystal structures have yielded insights into the structural changes induced by these effectors, but there remains a paucity of information to correlate any given structural change with specific consequences for FIXa function.Objectives: To correlate structural changes induced by these modulators with defined consequences for FIXa substrate discrimination and function.Methods: A peptidomics-based mass spectrometry (MS) approach was used to examine the patterns of hydrolysis of four combinatorial chemistry-derived pentapeptide libraries by FIXa under various conditions in a soluble, active enzyme system.Results: Ethylene glycol specifically altered the S3 subsite of FIXa to render it more tolerant to side chains at the P3 substrate position, whereas Ca2+ enhanced tolerance at the S2 subsite.

The role of local factors on the decline of the local stock was investigated, while additional information from the literature was also used to discuss the effects of global factors (including glass eel harvest for aquaculture, climateoceanographic changes, habitat loss, pollution and parasitism) on the three eel species A. anguilla, Anguilla japonica and Anguilla rostrata. 3. The records from Comacchio provided significant information about the effects of local factors on the local eel populations in the past. However, the current population collapse, which started in the 1970s, could not be explained by local factors. 4.

Coexistence of close relatives therefore poses an interesting scenario with regards to niche differentiation since these species generally have many traits in common due to shared ancestry. Native Californian Trifolium assemblages are locally diverse and represent a unique system for understanding competitive interactions among close relatives. 2. We conducted two similar greenhouse studies in which Trifolium fucatum was grown alone, with a con-specific competitor, and with a congeneric competitor (Trifolium macraei). In the first study, we assessed biomass production in T. fucatum, and in the second study we conducted an RNAseq analysis of T. fucatum roots to test for differentially expressed genes that may mediate competitive interactions and potentially coexistence. 3. Compared to plants grown alone, competition (i.e. growth in the same pot) with a conspecific resulted in a greater reduction in biomass than competition with a congener, as predicted by theory. However, competition with a congener resulted in twice as many differentially expressed genes as competition with a conspecific. 4. Annotations of identified genes differentiating congeneric from conspecific competition suggest several functions attributed to interactions with third-party organisms, including nodulation with rhizobial mutualists, and defence responses against pathogens and herbivores. In addition, salt-responsive genes and an iron transporter were differentially expressed in congeneric competition, and comparisons of sodium and iron concentrations in field soils where these species are found showed that T. fucatum occurs in higher sodium and iron microsites than T. macraei. Thus, the transcriptome highlighted abiotic niche axes worth pursuing in future ecological experiments as potential mediators of coexistence. 5. We also found a subset of genes that responded similarly to both congeneric and conspecific competition in both direction and magnitude, indicating some conserved responses to competition, regardless of neighbour identity. 6.

Landscape- scale predictors (e. g. land cover, land use, soil characteristics, geology, flow characteristics, and climate) were used to predict the suitability of individual stream segments for A. heterodon. 3. The best model contained variables at three scales: minimum elevation (segment scale), percentage Tertiary deposits, low intensity development, and woody wetlands (sub- catchment), and percentage low intensity development, pasture/ hay agriculture, and average depth to the water table (catchment).

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "1. Testosterone mediates several key aspects of male reproduction, but maintaining high testosterone levels can reduce long-term survival. One of the proposed pathways by which testosterone can influence survival is through increased risk of parasite infection. The hormone has the potential to affect the transmission of sexually transmitted infections by promoting behaviours that increase sexual contact rates and/or by decreasing immune function. 2. We hypothesized that males with high concentrations of testosterone would increase their chances of being infected with sexually transmitted bacteria, which would manifest as increased diversity of cloacal bacteria. To test this hypothesis, we measured circulating testosterone concentrations in breeding male rufous-collared sparrows (Zonotrichia capensis) and collected cloacal swabs to quantify bacterial diversity using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. 3. There was a positive correlation between testosterone concentrations and the phylogenetic diversity of cloacal bacteria. In addition, individuals with high and medium testosterone concentrations had cloacal bacterial communities that were more similar to each other than to those of low testosterone individuals. Finally, when considering bacterial taxa that are potential avian pathogens, we found that the relative abundance of Chlamydiae, a class of obligate intracellular parasites, was positively correlated with testosterone concentrations. 4. Two non-exclusive explanations for these results are that testosterone affects behaviours that lead to increased sexual contacts and thus the exposure and acquisition of additional phylogenetically diverse bacteria, and/or that testosterone is altering the immune system or the cloacal environment, thus making it easier for bacteria to colonize. Either way, these data suggest that increased exposure to sexually transmitted pathogens in the form of cloacal bacteria could be a cost of maintaining high testosterone levels."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Medical "}]}

However, the majority of published studies are carried under optimal water and nutrient regimes and with just one herbivore. But what happens when additional levels of ecological complexity are added? Does the presence of a second herbivore, microorganisms, and abiotic stress interfere with plant-natural enemy communication? or is communication stable enough to withstand disruption by additional biotic and abiotic factors? 2. Investigating the effects of these additional levels of ecological complexity is key to understanding the stability of tritrophic interactions in natural ecosystems and may aid to forecast the impact of environmental disturbances on these, especially in climate change scenarios, which are often associated with modifications in plant and arthropod species distribution and increased levels of abiotic stress. 3. This review explores the literature on natural enemy attraction to herbivore-induced volatiles when, besides herbivory, plants are challenged by additional biotic and abiotic factors. 4.

Hepatic microsomes from liver-specific 11 beta-HSD1-deficient mice were devoid of 7-oxoLCA oxidoreductase activity.

In the crystal structure the two domains are tightly associated, but small angle X-ray scattering data and dynamic fluorescence studies suggested a high degree of structural flexibility involving movement of the N-terminal domain relative to catalytic subunit. When we inspected the interdomain interface we have found a limited number of side-chain contacts which are involved in interactions of these two structural subunits. One of such contact points involves tyrosine 98 of N-terminal domain. This aromatic amino acid is invariant in vertebrate LOXs regardless of overall sequence identity. To explore in more detail the role of aromatic interactions in interdomain association we have mutated Y98 to various residues and quantified the structural and functional consequences of these alterations. We have found that loss of an aromatic moiety at position 98 impaired the catalytic activity and membrane binding capacity of the mutant enzymes.

The present study used mutagenesis and a combination of protein fluorescence, CD and kinetics experiments to investigate the roles of Arg420, Arg478 and Tyr392 in substrate binding and catalysis. The results support a random sequential, preferred order mechanism, and predict that Arg420 and Arg478 are involved in binding of the acceptor substrate, GraP. D-Glyceraldehyde, an alternative acceptor substrate lacking the phosphoryl group predicted to interact with Arg420 and Arg478, also accelerates decarboxylation of the predecarboxylation intermediate C2 alpha-lactylthiamin diphosphate (LThDP) on DXP synthase, indicating that this binding interaction is not absolutely required, and that the hydroxyaldehyde sufficiently triggers decarboxylation. Unexpectedly, Tyr392 contributes to GraP affinity, and is not required for LThDP formation or its GraP-promoted decarboxylation. Time-resolved CD spectroscopy and NMR experiments indicate that LThDP is significantly stabilized on R420A and Y392F variants as compared with wild-type DXP synthase in the absence of acceptor substrate, but these substitutions do not appear to affect the rate of GraP-promoted LThDP decarboxylation in the presence of high levels of GraP, and LThDP formation remains the rate-limiting step.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "3 beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type II deficiency (3 beta HSD2) congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a rare cause of ambiguous genitalia, resulting in abnormal virilisation in both 46XY and 46XX. We describe a case of 46XY ambiguous genitalia that was misdiagnosed as androgen insensitivity syndrome. The correct diagnosis was made after adrenarche. Genotyping demonstrated compound heterozygosity in two alleles, the previously described c.244G >A (p.Ala82Thr), and a novel 931C >.T(p. Gln311*) variant. We suggest that adrenarche unmasked the condition by driving cortisol production to rates that caused the mutant 3bHSD2 enzyme to become rate limiting for cortisol production. This case illustrates how markedly different the effects of this condition may be on androgen production compared with glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production. It also demonstrates how current guidelines based on urinary steroids and cortisol sufficiency may not arrive at the correct diagnosis, and underlines the importance of gene testing in the work-up of disorders of sexual differentiation."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "biochemistry "}]}
